### Huntress CTF 2024
Everyone has been super busy lately, but a couple of us managed to get into Huntress CTF and snagged a nice 127th place! This ctf lasted 30 days and had a very large challenge pool. Naturally, some challenges were particularly great! I rather enjoyed Permission To Proxy, MOVEable, Zippy, and Palimpsest!

120th place out of 5694 teams! This year felt a lot more competitive than last year, but we still managed to get a good placement! It was a very satisfying challenge.

### Advent of Cyber 2023
AoC is quickly becoming my annual tradition; it was very satisfying seeing how far I've come throughout the year, and how much more knowledge I've gained since the previous year's advent.

Once again some good challenges. I found Day19, the Frida showcase, to be my favorite of the set.
